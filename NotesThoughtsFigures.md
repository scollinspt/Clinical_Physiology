# Figure notes thoughts by chapter

# Introduction
What does it mean to have a muscle centered approach - a graphic that integrates all of the course into one figure, muscle and all that supports it labeled appropriately


Example of a model
Triangle of Fidelity, Efficacy and Integrity?
Core concepts?


# Fundamentals

If I make a figure of fidelity, efficacy and integrity it can be expanded for this section of the book - made to be more muscle focused, but not just muscle, muscle act - what is the act? Tension.

Figure of tension - compare / contrasting muscle to a rope

Muscle Scaffold

Musculotendonous junction

Bony attachment

Examples of pennation 

Introduce length - tension relationship?

Introduce force - velocity relationship?



# Tension


Anatomy of tension - microstructure (inside the sarcomere, myofilaments, etc); building the macrostructure by combining sarcomeres in series (myofilaments) and in parallel (fiber) - this may be several figures

Active 

Passive tension - elements involved, what does it mean, implications for cells and tissue, 

Sliding filament theory figure - all the steps in the process

Passive tension

Revisit the length - tension relationship

Revisit the force - velocity relationship
