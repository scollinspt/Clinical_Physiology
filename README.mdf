# Clinical Physiology
## A muscle centered approach

A manuscript in progress for a book (Open Educational Resource, OER) for use in the clinical physiology course in the DPT program at Plymouth State University. Once the second draft is completed we may seek a publisher so that a print version is available (at a cost). But the electronic version will remain licensed as an OER.

## Getting ready for the second draft (2023)

- Add a chapter called "Advice for the Reader based largely on Adler's "How to Read a Book"
- Create "Part I" to include Advice for the Reader, Introduction, Fundamentals
- Need a first draft for the Digestion, Absorption, Metabolism chapter (Kelly and Sean)
- Need a first draft for the integrity section (several chapters) (Sean and Kyle)
	- The detail necessary for this chapter is driven by the need to understand these concepts for muscle adaptation (changes in mass and function) to stressors, perturbations, interventions, injuries, etc.
- Need a first draft for the Integrative exercises section
  - Fick's Equation (Nathaniel)
  - Exercise Prescription (Kyle)
- Divide Blood Flow chapter into two - last year students got much more from the two "Pulmonary" chapters - divided into Ventilation and Respiration than they did from the one "Blood Flow" chapter. Need to decide the best way to divide that chapter to have it fit
- The pulmonary chapters (Ventilation and Respiration) need graphics to replace my drawings
- All second draft chapters need improved objectives
- All second draft chapters need proof reading and to be improved in terms of succinct, clear, language (write tight)
- All chapters need "Problems", "Exercises", "Thought" and/or "Reflection" questions throughout the chapter - should follow a section. Should also consider
- Consider adding an index and a glossary

## References

- Held on Zotero at this link: https://www.zotero.org/groups/4709608/clinical_phys_muscle
- Need to organize the Zotero files by chapter
- Need to do a deeper dive into topics to make them more relevant to PT.... more to come on this concept

## Graphics

- Need graphics for ventilation and respiration chapter
- Considering moving DAGitty based directed graph (bioenergetics) to either SimGen or Cytoscape
- Expand on directed graphics (most likely SimGen)
- Expansion of graphics should be paired with reduction of text, improved explanatory text of the graphic, and exercises for the reader to use the graphic for reasoning

## Longer term steps to the project

- Generate original graphics of simulation results using JSim models (or other Physiome based models)
