	abstract = {SUMMARY 1. The development of microneurography, in which an insulated tungsten microelectrode is inserted into an accessible peripheral or cranial nerve in awake human subjects, has allowed detailed analyses of the signalling capacities of single mechanoreceptive afferents from the skin, muscles and joints. For example, we know much about how the two classes of rapidly adapting (Meissner and Pacinian) and two classes of slowly adapting (Merkel and Ruffini) cutaneous mechanoreceptors encode forces applied normal or tangential to the skin of the hand and the similarities and differences in glabrous versus non-glabrous skin (and receptors associated with hairs). We also know about stretch- and force-sensitive endings in muscle (the muscle spindle and Golgi tendon organ, respectively) and how they behave during passive or active movements or during isometric contractions. In addition, we have characterized the firing properties of mechanoreceptors in the joint capsules of the fingers. However, we know little about sensory nerves in the periosteum, other than that nociceptors and Pacinian corpuscles exist. 2. In addition to studies on the physiology of sensory endings in human subjects, microstimulation through the recording microelectrode has revealed how the brain deals with the sensory information conveyed by a single afferent. From this work, we know that there is specificity in the sensory channels: electrical stimulation of a single Meissner or Pacinian corpuscle generates frequency dependent illusions of ‘flutter’ or ‘vibration’, whereas microstimulation of a single Merkel afferent can produce a percept of ‘pressure’ and stimulation of a single joint afferent can evoke a sensation of ‘joint rotation’. Interestingly, the input from a single Ruffini ending in the skin cannot be perceived and the same is true of muscle spindle afferents. So, where does this leave us with osseoperception from the mouth? Given that the periodontal receptors in the vicinity have been lost, which mechanoreceptive endings could encode forces applied to a bone-implanted prosthesis? 3. Meissner and Merkel endings have very small receptive fields and respond only to local forces. Pacinian corpuscles have an exquisite sensitivity to brisk mechanical events and could respond to such stimuli transmitted through the bone to a remote receptor, but would not be able to encode sustained forces. Ruffini endings also respond to forces applied remote to the receptive field and, unlike the Pacinian corpuscles, respond in a sustained fashion, but would their signals be perceived? Like muscle spindles, it is possible that the coactivation of many Ruffini endings could provide meaningful information. Finally, as we have seen, the input from a single joint receptor can be perceived, but they mostly respond at the limits of joint rotation, so it is unlikely that any associated with the temporomandibular joint could contribute to osseoperception.},

Porter and his laboratory defined the  SR, the unique junctions between SR and T tubules, and the continuity between T  tubules and surface membrane. Current research in this area centers on the  interaction between T tubules and SR. This is mediated by 2 well-identified  calcium channels: the dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs) that act as voltage  sensors in the T tubules, and the ryanodine receptors (RyRs) or calcium release  channels of the SR. The relative positions of these 2 molecules differ  significantly in skeletal and cardiac muscle, and this correlates well with known  functional differences in the control of contraction. Molecular biology  experiments combined with EM indicate that DHPRs are linked to RyRs in skeletal  but probably not in cardiac muscle.},

Muscle cross sections were stained for glycogen using a periodic acid-Schiff reaction, and single-fiber optical densities were determined to identify those fibers belonging to the stimulated motor unit. Innervation ratios were determined by counting the total number of muscle fibers in a motor unit in sections taken through several levels of the muscle. The average innervation ratios for the fast, fatigueable (FF) and fast, fatigue-resistant (FR) units were similar. However, the slow units (S) contained 61\% fewer fibers than the fast units (FF and FR). Muscle fibers belonging to S and FR units were similar in cross-sectional area, whereas fibers belonging to FF units were significantly larger than fibers belonging to either S or FR units. Additionally, muscle fibers innervated by a single motoneuron varied by two- to eightfold in cross-sectional area. Specific tensions, based on total cross-sectional area determined by summing the areas of all muscle fibers of each unit, showed a modest difference between fast and slow units, the means being 23.5 and 17.2 N X cm-2, respectively. Variations in maximum tension among units could be explained principally by innervation ratio, although fiber cross-sectional area and specific tension did contribute to differences between unit types.},

Several studies demonstrated the technique is reproducible and capable of following motor neuron loss in patients with ALS and peripheral polyneuropathies. The main goal of this review was to conduct an extensive review of the literature using MUNIX. We conducted a systematic search in English medical literature published in two databases (PubMed and SCOPUS). In this review, we aimed to answer the following queries: Comparison of MUNIX with other MUNE techniques; the reproducibility of MUNIX; the utility of MUNIX in ALS and preclinical muscles, peripheral neuropathies, and other neurological disorders.},

	abstract = {A quantitative stochastic model of the mechanochemical cycle of myosin, the protein that drives muscle contraction, is proposed. It is based on three premises: (i) the myosin head incorporates a lever arm, whose equilibrium position adjusts as each of the products of ATP hydrolysis dissociates from the nucleotide pocket; (ii) the chemical reaction rates are modified according to the work done in moving the arm; and (iii) the compliance of myosin’s elastic element is designed to permit many molecules to work together efficiently. The model has a minimal number of parameters and provides an explanation, at the molecular level, of many of the mechanical and thermodynamic properties of steadily shortening muscle. In particular, the inf lexion in the force–velocity curve at a force approaching the isometric load is reproduced. Moreover, the model indicates that when large numbers of myosin molecules act collectively, their chemical cycles can be synchronized, and that this leads to stepwise motion of the thin filament. The oscillatory transient response of muscle to abrupt changes of load is interpreted in this light.},

	abstract = {Background: Eccentric exercise increases muscle fascicle lengths; however, the mechanisms behind this adaptation are still unknown. This study aimed to determine whether biceps femoris long head (BFlh) fascicle length increases in response to 3 weeks of eccentric exercise training are the result of an in-series addition of sarcomeres within the muscle ﬁbers.
Methods: Ten recreationally active participants (age = 27 § 3 years; mass = 70 § 14 kg; height = 174 § 9 cm; mean § SD) completed 3 weeks of Nordic hamstring exercise (NHE) training on a custom exercise device that was instrumented with load cells. We collected in vivo sarcomere and muscle fascicle images of the BFlh in 2 regions (central and distal) by using microendoscopy and 3 dimension ultrasonography. We then estimated sarcomere length, sarcomere number, and fascicle length before and after the training intervention.
Results: Eccentric knee ﬂexion strength increased after the training (15\%; p {\textless} 0.001; hp2 = 0.75). Further, we found a signiﬁcant increase in fascicle length (21\%; p {\textless} 0.001; hp2 = 0.81) and sarcomere length (17\%; p {\textless} 0.001; hp2 = 0.90) in the distal but not in the central portion of the muscle. The estimated number of sarcomeres in series did not change in either region.
Conclusion: Fascicle length adaptations appear to be heterogeneous in the BFlh in response to 3 weeks of NHE training. An increase in sarcomere length, rather than the addition of sarcomeres in series, appears to underlie increases in fascicle length in the distal region of the BFlh. The mechanism driving regional increases in fascicle and sarcomere length remains unknown, but we speculate that it may be driven by regional changes in the passive tension of muscle or connective tissue adaptations.},

	abstract = {Sarcomere lengths have been a crucial outcome measure for understanding and explaining basic muscle properties and muscle function. Sarcomere lengths for a given muscle are typically measured at a single spot, often in the mid-belly of the muscle, and at a given muscle length. It is then assumed implicitly that the sarcomere length measured at this single spot represents the sarcomere lengths at other locations within the muscle, and force-length, force-velocity, and power-velocity properties of muscles are often implied based on these single sarcomere length measurements. Although, intuitively appealing, this assumption is yet to be supported by systematic evidence. The objective of this study was to measure sarcomere lengths at deﬁned locations along and across an intact muscle, at different muscle lengths. Using second harmonic generation (SHG) imaging technique, sarcomere patterns in passive mouse tibialis anterior (TA) were imaged in a non-contact manner at ﬁve selected locations (“proximal,” “distal,” “middle,” “medial,” and “lateral” TA sites) and at three different lengths encompassing the anatomical range of motion of the TA. We showed that sarcomere lengths varied substantially within small regions of the muscle and also for different sites across the entire TA. Also, sarcomere elongations with muscle lengthening were non-uniform across the muscle, with the highest sarcomere stretches occurring near the myotendinous junction. We conclude that muscle mechanics derived from sarcomere length measured from a small region of a muscle may not well-represent the sarcomere length and associated functional properties of the entire muscle.},

	abstract = {Sarcomere length is a key physiological parameter that affects muscle force output; however, our understanding of the scaling of human muscle from sarcomere to whole muscle is based primarily on cadaveric data. The aims of this study were to explore the in vivo relationship between passive fascicle length and passive sarcomere length at different muscle-tendon unit lengths and determine whether sarcomere and fascicle length relationships are the same in different regions of muscle. A microendoscopy needle probe capable of in vivo sarcomere imaging was inserted into a proximal location of the human tibialis anterior muscle at three different ankle positions [5° dorsiflexion, 5° plantar flexion (PF), and 15° PF] and one distal location at a constant ankle position (5° PF distal). Ultrasound imaging of tibialis anterior fascicles, centered on the location of the needle probe, was performed for each condition to estimate fascicle length. Sarcomere length and fascicle length increased with increasing muscle-tendon unit length, although the correlation between sarcomere length change and muscle fascicle length change was only moderate ( r
              2
               = 0.45). Passive sarcomere length was longer at the distal imaging site than the proximal site ( P = 0.01). When sarcomere number was estimated from sarcomere length and fascicle length, there were fewer sarcomeres in the fibers of distal location than the proximal location ( P = 0.01). These data demonstrate that fascicle length changes are representative of sarcomere length changes, although significant variability in sarcomere length exists within a muscle and sarcomere number per fiber is region-dependent.
            
            NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Sarcomere and fascicle lengths were measured in vivo from human muscle to examine the relationship between the different scales of organization. Changes in fascicle length were moderately related to sarcomere length changes; however, sarcomere length and number per fiber varied from proximal to distal regions of the muscle. Differences in average sarcomere operating lengths across the muscle suggest potentially different stresses or strains experienced within different regions of muscle.},

	abstract = {Skeletal muscle contractures represent the permanent shortening of a muscle-tendon unit, resulting in loss of elasticity and, in extreme cases, joint deformation. They may result from cerebral palsy, spinal cord injury, stroke, muscular dystrophy, and other neuromuscular disorders. Contractures are the prototypic and most severe clinical presentation of increased passive mechanical muscle force in humans, often requiring surgical correction. Intraoperative experiments demonstrate that high muscle passive force is associated with sarcomeres that are abnormally stretched, although otherwise normal, with fewer sarcomeres in series. Furthermore, changes in the amount and arrangement of collagen in the extracellular matrix also increase muscle stiffness. Structural light and electron microscopy studies demonstrate that large bundles of collagen, referred to as perimysial cables, may be responsible for this increased stiffness and are regulated by interaction of a number of cell types within the extracellular matrix. Loss of muscle satellite cells may be related to changes in both sarcomeres and extracellular matrix. Future studies are required to determine the underlying mechanism for changes in muscle satellite cells and their relationship (if any) to contracture. A more complete understanding of this mechanism may lead to effective nonsurgical treatments to relieve and even prevent muscle contractures.},

Mean sarcomere lengths at 10° plantarflexion were 2.84±0.09 μm (mean ±S.E.M.), near the optimal length for sarcomere force generation. Sarcomere lengths were 3.43±0.09 μm at 20° dorsiflexion, indicating that they were longer than optimal length when the ankle was in dorsiflexion and the muscle was inactive. Our results indicate a smaller sarcomere length difference between two ankle flexion angles compared to estimates from musculoskeletal models and suggest why these models frequently underestimate the force-generating capacity of the soleus.},

In this study, we used SHG microendoscopy to visualize sarcomeres of the human vastus lateralis, a large knee extensor muscle important for mobility, to examine how sarcomere lengths change with knee ﬂexion and thus affect the muscle's force-generating capacity. We acquired in vivo sarcomere images of several muscle ﬁbers of the resting vastus lateralis in six healthy individuals. Mean sarcomere lengths increased (p¼ 0.031) from 2.84 7 0.16 μm at 50° of knee ﬂexion to 3.17 70.13 μm at 110° of knee ﬂexion. The standard deviation of sarcomere lengths among different ﬁbers within a muscle was 0.21 70.09 μm. Our results suggest that the sarcomeres of the resting vastus lateralis at 50° of knee ﬂexion are near optimal length. At a knee ﬂexion angle of 110° the resting sarcomeres of vastus lateralis are longer than optimal length. These results show a smaller sarcomere length change and greater conservation of force-generating capacity with knee ﬂexion than estimated in previous studies.},

The common practice is to measure the mean sarcomere length (SL) in a relaxed muscle at a single location and at a given length, and this mean SL is assumed to represent the SLs at other locations across the muscle. However, in a previous study, we found that SLs are highly non-uniform across an intact passive muscle. Moreover, SL non-uniformity increases during activation in single myoﬁbril experiments. Myoﬁbrils lack some structural proteins that comprise an intact muscle, and therefore, the increased SL dispersion upon activation seen in myoﬁbrils may not occur in intact whole muscle. The objectives of the current study were (i) to measure the distribution of SLs in an activated intact muscle; and (ii) to assess the feasibility of using the mean SL measured at a speciﬁc location of the muscle to predict muscle force. Using state-of-the-art multi-photon microscopy and a miniature tendon force transducer, in vivo sarcomeres in the mouse tibialis anterior were imaged simultaneously with muscle force during isometric tetanic contractions. We found that in vivo SL dispersion increased substantially during activation and reached average differences of ∼1.0 µm. These differences in SL are associated with theoretical force differences of 70–100\% of the maximal isometric force. Furthermore, SLs measured at a single location in the passive muscle were poor predictors of active force potential. Although mean SLs in the activated muscle were better predictors of force potential, predicted forces still differed by as much as 35\% from the experimentally measured maximal isometric forces.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Serial sarcomere number determines a muscle’s length during maximum force production and its available length range for active force generation. Skeletal muscle length adapts to functional demands; for example, animal studies demonstrate that chronically shortened muscles decrease length by losing serial sarcomeres. This phenomenon has never been demonstrated in humans. Integrating multiscale imaging techniques, including two-photon microendoscopy, an innovative advance from traditional invasive measurement methods at the sarcomere scale, we establish that chronic impairments that place a muscle in a shortened position are associated with the loss of serial sarcomeres in humans. Understanding how muscle adapts following impairment is critical to the design of more effective clinical interventions to mitigate such adaptations and to improve function following motor impairments.
          , 
            
              A muscle’s structure, or architecture, is indicative of its function and is plastic; changes in input to or use of the muscle alter its architecture. Stroke-induced neural deficits substantially alter both input to and usage of individual muscles. We combined in vivo imaging methods (second-harmonic generation microendoscopy, extended field-of-view ultrasound, and fat-suppression MRI) to quantify functionally meaningful architecture parameters in the biceps brachii of both limbs of individuals with chronic hemiparetic stroke and in age-matched, unimpaired controls. Specifically, serial sarcomere number (SSN) and physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) were calculated from data collected at three anatomical scales: sarcomere length, fascicle length, and muscle volume. The interlimb differences in SSN and PCSA were significantly larger for stroke participants than for participants without stroke (
              P
              = 0.0126 and
              P
              = 0.0042, respectively), suggesting we observed muscle adaptations associated with stroke rather than natural interlimb variability. The paretic biceps brachii had ∼8,200 fewer serial sarcomeres and ∼2 cm
              2
              smaller PCSA on average than the contralateral limb (both
              P
              {\textless} 0.0001). This was manifested by substantially smaller muscle volumes (112 versus 163 cm
              3
              ), significantly shorter fascicles (11.0 versus 14.0 cm;
              P
              {\textless} 0.0001), and comparable sarcomere lengths (3.55 versus 3.59 μm;
              P
              = 0.6151) between limbs. Most notably, this study provides direct evidence of the loss of serial sarcomeres in human muscle observed in a population with neural impairments that lead to disuse and chronically place the affected muscle at a shortened position. This adaptation is consistent with functional consequences (increased passive resistance to elbow extension) that would amplify already problematic, neurally driven motor impairments.},

	abstract = {The lengths of a muscle’s sarcomeres are a primary determinant of its ability to contract and produce force. In addition, sarcomere length is a critical parameter that is required to make meaningful comparisons of both the force-generating and excursion capacities of different muscles. Until recently, in vivo sarcomere length data have been limited to invasive or intraoperative measurement techniques. With the advent of second harmonic generation microendoscopy, minimally invasive measures of sarcomere length can be made for the ﬁrst time. This imaging technique expands our ability to study muscle adaptation due to changes in stimulus, use, or disease. However, due to past inability to measure sarcomeres outside of surgery or biopsy, little is known about the natural, anatomical variability in sarcomere length in living human subjects. To develop robust experimental protocols that ensure data provide accurate representations of a muscle’s sarcomere lengths, we sought to quantify experimental uncertainty associated with in vivo measures of sarcomere lengths. Speciﬁcally, we assessed the variability in sarcomere length measured (1) within a single image, along a muscle ﬁber, (2) across images captured within a single trial, across trials, and across days, as well as (3) across locations in the muscle using second harmonic generation in two upper limb muscles with different muscle architectures, functions, and sizes. Across all of our measures of variability we estimate that the magnitude of the uncertainty for in vivo sarcomere length is on the order of ∼0.25 µm. In the two upper limb muscles studied we found larger variability in sarcomere lengths within a single insertion than across locations. We also developed custom code to make measures of sarcomere length variability across a single ﬁber and determined that this codes’ accuracy is an order of magnitude smaller than our measurement uncertainty due to sarcomere variability. Together, our ﬁndings provide guidance for the development of robust experimental design and analysis of in vivo sarcomere lengths in the upper limb.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, a multitude of concepts and models were developed to understand, assess and predict muscular mechanics in the context of physiological and pathological events. Most of these models are highly specialized and designed to selectively address fields in, e.g., medicine, sports science, forensics, product design or CGI; their data are often not transferable to other ranges of application. A single universal model, which covers the details of biochemical and neural processes, as well as the development of internal and external force and motion patterns and appearance could not be practical with regard to the diversity of the questions to be investigated and the task to find answers efficiently. With reasonable limitations though, a generalized approach is feasible. The objective of the work at hand was to develop a model for muscle simulation which covers the phenomenological aspects, and thus is universally applicable in domains where up until now specialized models were utilized. This includes investigations on active and passive motion, structural interaction of muscles within the body and with external elements, for example in crash scenarios, but also research topics like the verification of in vivo experiments and parameter identification. For this purpose, elements for the simulation of incompressible deformations were studied, adapted and implemented into the finite element code SLang. Various anisotropic, visco-elastic muscle models were developed or enhanced. The applicability was demonstrated on the base of several examples, and a general base for the implementation of further material models was developed and elaborated.},

However, the molecular mechanisms leading to the morphological and functional perturbations in the pre- and post-synaptic compartments of the NMJ remain poorly understood. Here, we discuss the role of the metabolic pathway associated to the kinase TOR (Target of Rapamycin) in the development, maintenance and alterations of the NMJ. This is of particular interest as the TOR pathway has been implicated in aging, but its role at the NMJ is still illdeﬁned. We highlight the respective functions of the two TOR-associated complexes, TORC1 and TORC2, and discuss the role of localized protein synthesis and autophagy regulation in motor neuron terminals and sub-synaptic regions of muscle ﬁbers and their possible effects on NMJ maintenance.},

Subjects reported for a total of 5 sessions which consisted of a 1RM testing session and 4 experimental trials. The 4 experimental conditions consisted of a traditional load (TRAD), traditional load with inter-repetition rest (TRDC), accentuated eccentric loading with inter-repetition rest (AELC), and Accentuated eccentric loading for the first repetition only (AEL1). Concentric load was 80\% of subjects’ 1RM for all conditions. An eccentric overload of 105\% of 1RM was applied using weight-releasing hooks during the AEL conditions. TRDC demonstrated superior concentric outputs for mean velocity and mean power compared with TRAD, AELC, and AEL1 (p , 0.001). In addition, AEL1 produced significantly greater effects for rate of force development compared with TRDC (p , 0.001). These findings suggest that inter-repetition rest had an influence on concentric performance, specifically mean power and mean velocity, and may be favorable when using higher loads and when sustained power outputs are desired. In addition, AEL1 may provide a unique eccentric stimulus that alters loading parameters compared with traditional loading conditions.},

J Strength Cond Res 36(6): 1560–1567, 2022—This experiment examined changes to the rate of force development (RFD) expressed under loaded jump conditions between individuals with a higher (stronger) and lower (weaker) weightlifting performance (as assessed by the 1 repetition maximum [RM] power clean) after training with the weightlifting derivatives. Two groups of markedly different weightlifting ability undertook 10 weeks of training with the power clean variants, snatch pulls, and jump squats across heavy and light conditions. Testing was performed at baseline, after 5 weeks of training (midtest) and after training (post-test). During testing, RFD was assessed under a series of loads (20–80\% squat 1RM) through the jump squat. Furthermore, the force-velocity relationship, and unloaded jump strategy (through the force-time curve waveform), were also examined. Very large change (Hedge’s g, 95\% confidence interval [g] 5 2.10, 1.24 to 4.16) in RFD at 20\% 1RM at mid-test occurred within the stronger group. Conversely, a small increase (g 5 0.27, 0.53–1.91) among the weaker subjects existed in this measure at mid-test, reaching a moderate increase at post-test (g 5 0.71, 20.18 to 2.15). Limited improvements were seen by the stronger subjects in RFD at 60 and 80\% 1RM at either mid-test (60\%: g 5 0.27, 20.75 to 1.33; 80\% 5 0.02, 21.01 to 1.00) or post-test (60\%: g 5 0.52, 20.38 to 1.80; 80\% 5 20.26, 21.23 to 0.77). The stronger group experienced a shift throughout the force-velocity relationship while a more force-dominant adaptation occurred in weaker subjects. Differences in jump strategy between groups were also noted. Such training will elicit practically different adaptations in rapid force production depending on the individual’s baseline weightlifting ability.},

J Strength Cond Res 36(6): 1610–1617, 2022—This study aimed to verify the reliability of the BodyMetrix portable A-mode ultrasound in measuring fat and muscle tissue thickness. Thirty physically active men participated in daily body composition evaluations. The evaluations comprised 2 techniques: (a) graphic technique (GTBM), which measured the fat thickness at 9 body sites (abdomen, axillary, biceps brachii, calf, chest, subscapular, suprailiac, thigh, and triceps brachii), and (b) imaging technique (ITBM), which simultaneously measured the fat and muscle thickness of 6 body surfaces (abdomen, biceps brachii, chest, thigh, trapezius, and triceps brachii). Regarding GTBM, relative reliability was moderate to excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]: 0.81–0.98), whereas absolute reliability was acceptable for abdomen, calf, chest, subscapular, suprailiac, and triceps brachii (coefficient of variation [CV]: 6.9–8.8\%) but high for axillary, biceps brachii, and thigh (CV: 12.0–17.4\%) in measuring fat thicknesses. Concerning ITBM, relative reliability was good to excellent (ICC: 0.93–0.99 and 0.90–0.98), whereas absolute reliability was acceptable (CV: 3.0–9.2\% and 3.5–5.9\%) in measuring fat and muscle thickness, respectively. These findings suggest that the, GTBM was only reliable in measuring fat thickness of abdomen, calf, chest, subscapular, suprailiac, and triceps brachii, whereas ITBM was reliable in measuring both fat and muscle thickness in all regions, but showed better reliability values in measuring muscle than fat thickness.},

J Strength Cond Res 36(6): 1660–1666, 2022—The aims of this study were to compare the magnitude and direction of asymmetry in comparable bilateral and unilateral countermovement jumps (CMJs). Forty-five elite academy soccer players from under-23 (n 5 15), under-18 (n 5 16), and under-16 (n 5 14) age groups performed bilateral and unilateral CMJs as part of their routine preseason fitness testing. For the magnitude of asymmetry, no significant differences were evident for any metric between tests. However, the eccentric impulse asymmetry was significantly greater than mean force and concentric impulse in both bilateral and unilateral tests (p , 0.01). For the direction of asymmetry, Kappa coefficients showed poor levels of agreement between test measures for all metrics (mean force 5 20.15, concentric impulse 5 20.07, and eccentric impulse 5 20.13). The mean jump data were also presented relative to the body mass for each group. For the bilateral CMJ, significant differences were evident between groups but showed little consistency in the same group performing better or worse across metrics. For the unilateral CMJ, eccentric impulse was the only metric to show meaningful differences between groups, with the under-18 group performing significantly worse than under-23 and under-16 players. This study highlights that despite the magnitude of asymmetry being similar for each metric between comparable bilateral and unilateral CMJs, consistency in the direction of asymmetry was poor. In essence, if the right limb produced the larger force or impulse during a bilateral CMJ, it was rare for the same limb to perform superior during the unilateral task. Thus, practitioners should be aware that bilateral and unilateral CMJs present different limb dominance characteristics and should not use 1 test to represent the other when measuring between-limb asymmetries.},

A systematic review. J Strength Cond Res 36(6): 1753–1762, 2022—Fitness professionals routinely employ a variety of resistance training exercises in program design as a strategy to enhance muscular adaptations. However, it remains uncertain whether such an approach offers advantages over a fixed-exercise selection. The objective of this review was to review the effects of exercise variation on muscle hypertrophy and strength. A search of the literature was conducted using PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Eight studies were identified as meeting inclusion criteria. The combined total sample of the studies was N 5 241, comprising all young men. The methodological quality of included studies was considered “good” and “excellent” based on the Physiotherapy Evidence Database Scale. The available studies indicate that varying exercise selection can influence muscle hypertrophy and strength gains. Some degree of systematic variation seems to enhance regional hypertrophic adaptations and maximize dynamic strength, whereas excessive, random variation may compromise muscular gains. We conclude that exercise variation should be approached systematically with a focus on applied anatomical and biomechanical constructs; on the contrary, employing different exercises that provide a redundant stimulus, as well as excessive rotation of different exercises (i.e., high frequency of change), may actually hinder muscular adaptations.},

J Strength Cond Res 35(8): 2170–2178, 2021—The study was designed to investigate the validity of different technologies used to determine movement velocity in resistance training. Twenty-four experienced powerlifters (18 male and 6 female; age, 25.1 6 5.1 years) completed a progressive loading test in the squat, bench press, and conventional deadlift until reaching their 1 repetition maximum. Peak and mean velocity were simultaneously recorded with 4 field-based systems: GymAware (GA), FitroDyne (FD), PUSH (PU), and Beast Sensor (BS). 3D motion capturing was used to calculate specific gold standard trajectory references for each device. GA provided the most accurate output across exercises (r 5 0.99–1, ES 5 20.05 to 0.1). FD showed similar results for peak velocity (r 5 1, standardized mean bias [ES] 5 20.1 to 20.02) but considerably less validity for mean velocity (r 5 0.92–0.95, ES 5 20.57 to 20.29). Reasonably valid to highly valid output was provided by PU in all exercises (r 5 0.91–0.97, ES 5 20.5 to 0.28) and by BS in the bench press and for mean velocity in the squat (r 5 0.87–0.96, ES 5 20.5 to 20.06). However, BS did not reach the thresholds for reasonable validity in the deadlift and for peak velocity in the squat, mostly due to high standardized mean bias (ES 5 20.78 to 20.63). In conclusion, different technologies should not be used interchangeably. Practitioners who require negligible measurement error in their assessment of movement velocity are advised to use linear position transducers over inertial sensors.},

J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000–000, 2019—The purpose of this study was to review all scientific publications related to able-body drug-tested classic powerlifting performance since January 1, 2012, and to regroup them into a brief narrative review. Three electronic databases were systematically searched in August 2018 using the wildcard: powerlift*. A manual search was performed from the reference list of all retained articles. The search and selection strategy permitted to gather a total of 16 scientific articles published in peer-reviewed journals. Results show that practitioners should prioritize a low-bar squat and a wide grip bench press because they generally contribute to moving greater loads, bring more attention to preventing injuries, since a fair amount of powerlifters seem to train injured and prioritize a hypertrophy-power-strength model when prescribing 3 times a week daily undulating periodization on nonconsecutive days for squat and bench. Practitioners could also introduce respiratory muscle training, use daily 1 repetition maximum training combined with down sets on experienced athletes and use a rate of perceived exertion scale based on repetitions in reserve combined with an individual velocity profile when prescribing intensity. Before competition, powerlifters seem to taper in this order: the deadlift, the squat, and lastly the bench press. The Slingshot does help to move more weight because it helps to generate more inertia, but it also deactivates the triceps. Finally, the present work was limited by the present literature but could serve as a reference in the field of powerlifting. Further research should include more details about the circumstances under which they were conducted.},

J Strength Cond Res 34(9): 2412–2418, 2020—Strength is a fundamental component of athletic performance and development. This investigation examined the long-term strength development of powerlifting (PL) athletes. The rate of strength gain/day was assessed in 1897 PL athletes (F 5 626, M 5 1,271) over a 15-year period (2003–2018). Independent T-tests explored sex differences in baseline absolute (kg) and relative strength (kg·body mass21 [bm]) recorded from the first competition, and strength gain/day (kg·d21). Analyses based on initial strength quartiles were conducted using one-way analysis of variances with significance set at p , 0.05. Bivariate correlational analysis tested for relationships between strength gain/day and baseline strength, the number of competitions, and mean days between competitions. Males had greater absolute (M: 513.3 6 99.8 kg, F: 289.4 6 55.7 kg, p , 0.001) and relative (M: 5.89 6 1.04 kg·bm21, F: 4.27 6 0.85 kg·bm21, p , 0.001) strength at baseline. Overall, strength gain/day (F: 0.12 6 0.69 kg·d21, M: 0.15 6 0.44 kg·d21, p 5 0.318) was similar between sexes. However, the strongest males showed a lower rate of strength improvement (0.102 kg·d21) compared with least strong males (0.211 kg·d21), p 5 0.010. No differences were observed across quartiles for females. Correlational analyses revealed significant but weak negative relationships between strength gain/day and the mean days between competitions for females (r2 5 20.120, p 5 0.003) and males (r2 5 2 0.190, p , 0.001). Similar relationships were observed for baseline strength (r2 5 20.073, p 5 0.009) and the number of competitions (r2 5 20.111, p , 0.001) for males. The results suggest similar strength adaptation between sexes. The strongest males improve more slowly, possibly due to a ceiling effect. Collectively, the findings provide novel evidence of real-world long-term strength adaptations that may be particularly useful to understand athlete development, to aid periodized programming, and to benchmark strength over time.},

J Strength Cond Res 34(5): 1213–1219, 2020—Powerlifting (PL) requires athletes to achieve the highest possible “total” weight lifted across squat, bench press, and deadlift. Athletes compete multiple times per year; however, it is not well understood how often PL athletes should compete to facilitate maximal strength performance. This study investigated the effect of competition frequency on strength (relative and absolute) in PL athletes over a 12-month period. Results across all male (n 5 563, mean 6 SD; age; 28 6 10 years, body mass; 89.3 6 19.3 kg) and female (n 5 437, age; 31 6 11 years, body mass; 70.1 6 15.8 kg) PL athletes were collated. Total competition scores were used to calculate absolute and relative strength for each competition. Linear mixed models with random effects, and effect sizes 6 95\% confidence intervals compared competition frequency and total score for (a) all, (b) male, and (c) female competition entries, respectively. The association between total score at each competition was assessed with Pearson’s correlation coefficient for the same independent variables. Results demonstrate greater absolute strength at competition 2 for all athletes (5.1\%: p 5 0.043: d 5 0.16) and males (2.9\%: p 5 0.049: d 5 0.15).

Weak positive correlations for relative strength and number of times competed for males were evident between competitions 1 to 4 (r2 5 0.070–0.085, p 5 0.003–0.043). For females, 3 competitions weakly correlated with absolute strength (r2 5 0.106, p 5 0.016). PL athletes who compete multiple times per year are more likely to achieve higher totals; however, there is an upper limit to the number of competitions (4 per year) that seem to allow a performance increase.},

J Strength Cond Res 32(1): 201–204, 2018—Currently, the sport of powerlifting discriminates against bench press scores and uses an empirical equation which is very difﬁcult to update to determine the best lifter within sex. The purpose of this study was to provide a simple and statistically sound method for evaluating powerlifting performance which could also be used with other multievent sports. Data were collected from a large public database on the top 50 (men) or the top 30 (women) individual raw competition scores in each weight class for each of the 3 powerlifting lifts. Mean and SDs were then calculated for each lift and weight class by sex. Powerlifting performance was evaluated by the sum of the 3 z-scores for the 3 lifts divided by 3 (the highest score wins). The z-scores reﬂect a dimensionless number which can be used to evaluate each lift and the total of the 3 lifts across weight classes and between sexes. Although the mean and SDs should be relatively stable, this computation is transparent and can be readily updated as lifters improve. This system overcomes the bias against bench press and many of the measurement challenges in evaluating athletes in multievent sports, in multiple weight divisions, and between sexes. These ﬁndings can beneﬁt coaches and athletes by allowing simpler evaluations of performance and improvement.},

The athletes were interviewed about their tapering practices using a semi-structured interview after which the audio content was transcribed.

Training intensity was maintained or increased during the taper, and it reached its highest values 8 6 3 days before the competition. Training frequency was reduced or maintained during the taper. The ﬁnal week included a reduction in training frequency by 47.9 6 17.5\% with the last training session performed 3 6 1 days before the competition. The participants typically stated that the main reasons for conducting the taper were maintaining strength and reducing the amount of fatigue. They also stated that (a) the taper was structured identically for the squat, bench press, and the deadlift; (b) the training during the taper was highly speciﬁc, the assistance exercises were removed, and the same equipment was used as during competition; (c) the source of information for tapering was their coach, and training ﬂuctuated based on the coach’s feedback; and (d) nutrition, foam rolling, static stretching, and massage were all given extra attention during the taper.

J Strength Cond Res 32(7): 1843–1851, 2018—In this article, we report 47,913 ofﬁcially judged contestant results from powerlifting matches from January 1, 2012 to June 11, 2016 for the USA Powerlifting Federation. We found age and sex to be the most complex factors in predicting powerlifting results. For women, in general, the younger the woman is the more they can squat; the older the woman is the less they can squat. For men and women, with the 1 exception for women’s squat, the peak age of lifting power is between the ages 24–49, at which point lifting power slowly declines. Women’s peak performance declines faster than men’s peak performance. Women seem to reach their peak sooner than men and decline sooner than men. We also analyzed match attendance. At matches with a large number of competitors, there is a 1:1.7 ratio of women to men, approximately a 2–3 ratio of women to men. Except for the lightest weight category of men, the ratio of weight to lift decreases the more they weigh. For example, a lighter person can generally lift a greater percentage of their weight than a heavier person. In addition, men in general can lift a heavier ratio of their weight when compared with women. The powerlifting stereotype of mostly heavy men lifting extremely large amounts of weights is simply wrong. There is a large amount of variation in age, weight, and sex.},

Myosin heavy chain composition, creatine analogues, and the relationship of muscle creatine content and fast-twitch proportion to Wilks coefficient in powerlifters. J Strength Cond Res 34(11): 3022–3030, 2020—Little data exist on powerlifting-specific skeletal muscle adaptations, and none elucidate sex differences in powerlifters. Powerlifters tend to display higher fast-twitch fiber content and phosphagen system dependence. Nevertheless, it is unknown whether fast-twitch fiber or muscle creatine content are predictive of competitive powerlifting performance (via Wilks coefficient). Twelve actively competing powerlifters (PL; n 5 6M/6F; age 5 21.3 6 1.0; 3.0 6 1.8 year competing; 7.3 6 6.6 meets attended) and 10 sedentary controls (CON; n 5 5M/5F; age 5 19.4 6 2.0 year) underwent vastus lateralis muscle biopsies and venipuncture to compare the myosin heavy chain (MHC) fiber type and creatine analogue profiles between groups of both sexes, and determine whether MHC IIa and muscle total creatine (MTC) composition predict powerlifting performance. Samples were analyzed for specific MHC isoform (I, IIa, and IIx) content via mixed homogenate SDS-PAGE, and creatine analogues (MTC, muscle creatine transporter [SLC6A8], serum total creatine [STC], and serum creatinine [CRT]). Furthermore, MHC IIa and MTC content were compared with Wilks coefficient using Pearson correlation coefficients. Male PL MHC content was 50 6 6\% I, 45 6 6\% IIa, and 5 6 11\% IIx, versus 46 6 6\% I, 53 6 6 IIa, and 0\% IIx in female PL. Conversely, male CON MHC content was 33 6 5\% I, 38 6 7\% IIa, and 30 6 8\% IIx, vs. 35 6 9\% I, 44 6 8\% IIa, and 21 6 17\% IIx in female CON. Muscle total creatine, SLC6A8, STC, and CRT did not significantly differ between groups nor sexes. Finally, neither MHC IIa content (r 5 20.288; p 5 0.364) nor MTC (r 5 0.488; p 5 0.108) significantly predicted Wilks coefficient, suggesting these characteristics alone do not determine powerlifting skill variation.},

J Strength Cond Res 36(3): 633–640, 2022—The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of 3 vs. 5 days of training cessation on body composition, perceived recovery and stress state, and maximal strength. Nineteen strength-trained athletes (23.8 6 4.1 year; 90.8 6 20.7 kg; 174.2 6 7.3 cm) completed a powerlifting specific 4-week training block followed by either 3 or 5 days of training cessation. During the 4-week training block, athletes were trained 3 days per week, performing 3–4 movements that included at least 2–3 competition lifts per session while performing 4–5 sets of 3–5 repetitions with intensity ranging from 75 to 100\% 1 repetition maximum (1RM). Body composition, psychometric measures, upper-body maximal strength, and lower-body maximal strength were assessed before (T1) and after 4 weeks of training (T2) and at 3 or 5 days of training cessation (T3). The alpha level was set at p , 0.05. After the 4-week training block (T1 to T2), trivial significant increases in body mass (p 5 0.016, Hedge’s g 5 0.04) and bench press 1RM (p 5 0.01, g 5 0.16) were observed, as well as small significant increases in back squat 1RM (p , 0.001, g 5 0.23), deadlift 1RM (p 5 0.003, g 5 0.20), powerlifting total (p , 0.001, g 5 0.21), and Wilks Score (p , 0.001, g 5 0.27). There were no significant differences between groups for isometric back squat performance, psychometric measures, and body composition after training cessation (T2–T3). However, small significant decreases in isometric bench press performance were observed after 5 days (p , 0.001, g 5 0.16), but not 3 days of training cessation. The results of this study suggest maximal lower-body strength can be preserved during 3 and 5 days of training cessation, but maximal upper-body strength is only preserved for 3 days after 4 weeks of strength training in athletes.},

J Strength Cond Res 26(5): 1274–1280, 2012—This study investigated the effects of powerlifting gear on training volume and performance, deﬁned by the squat, bench press, and deadlift. Eighteen powerlifters (18–26 years) were randomized into either a group that trained and competed using compressive gear (CG) or without the gear (NON). Training volume, volume progression, and powerlifting performance were assessed before and after 10 weeks of training. Training volume increased in the ﬁrst 4 weeks for both groups. Volume lifted for squat and the totals were greater in the CG. There was an increase in squat (19.05 6 30.97 lb, p = 0.02), deadlift (19.05 6 21.17 lb, p = 0.001), and the total score (44.00 6 60.44 lb, p = 0.005) for both the groups. The improvements in squat (CG = 33.85 vs. NON = 5.74, p = 0.07) and totals (CG = 66.59 vs. NON = 23.67, p = 0.15) were greater in the CG. Both groups showed a signiﬁcant and similar increase in the Wilks scores (+13.54 points, p = 0.03). There was a trend toward greater volume progression in those wearing CG during the initial stages of training. Both the groups signiﬁcantly improved performance for the squat, and deadlift, and had higher totals, and Wilks scores, indicating signiﬁcant strength gains. The greater magnitude of improvements in the squat and totals for the CG lifters suggests an ergogenic potential of training with powerlifting gear.},

J Strength Cond Res 35(12S): S26–S35, 2021—The purpose of this study was to characterize the tapering practices used by North American powerlifters. A total of 364 powerlifters completed a 41-item survey encompassing demographics, general training, general tapering, and specific tapering practices. Nonparametric statistics were used to assess sex (male and female), competition level (regional/provincial, national, and international), and competition lift (squat, bench press, and deadlift). The highest training volume most frequently took place 5–8 weeks before competition, whereas the highest training intensity was completed 2 weeks before competition. A step taper was primarily used over 7–10 days while decreasing the training volume by 41–50\% with varied intensity. The final heavy (.85\% 1 repetition maximum [1RM]) back squat and deadlift sessions were completed 7–10 days before competition, whereas the final heavy bench press session was completed ,7 days before competition. Final heavy lifts were completed at 90.0–92.5\% 1RM but reduced to 75–80\% 1RM for back squat and bench press and 70–75\% for deadlift during the final training session of each lift. Set and repetition schemes during the taper varied between lifts with most frequent reports of 3 3 2, 3 3 3, and 3 3 1 for back squat, bench press, and deadlift, respectively. Training cessation durations before competition varied between deadlift (5.8 6 2.5 days), back squat (4.1 6 1.9 days), and bench press (3.9 6 1.8 days). Complete training cessation was implemented 2.8 6 1.1 days before competition and varied between sex and competition level. These findings provide novel insights into the tapering practices of North American powerlifters and can be used to inform powerlifting coaches and athlete’s tapering decisions.},

J Strength Cond Res 32 (11): 3020–3028, 2018—The aim of this study was to investigate range of motion (ROM) and training patterns in powerlifters. Upper- and lower-extremity passive ROMs were assessed through goniometry in 15 male powerlifters (35.3 6 13.7 years) and 15 age-matched controls (34.9 6 14.6 years). The Apley scratch test and modiﬁed Thomas test were used to assess ROM across multiple joints. Training frequency, stretching frequency, and exercise selection were recorded using questionnaires. Passive glenohumeral (GH) extension, internal rotation, and external rotation ROM were signiﬁcantly decreased in powerlifters (p , 0.050). Powerlifters displayed decreased ROM in the Apley scratch test in both dominant (p = 0.015) and nondominant (p = 0.025) arms. However, knee extension angle was markedly improved in powerlifters (20.3 6 7.38) compared with controls (29.9 6 6.28; p , 0.001). Bench press and bench press variations accounted for 74.8\% of all upper-body exercises, whereas back squat and deadlift accounted for 79.7\% of all lower-body exercises in powerlifters’ training programs. To determine whether existing ROM adaptations were seen in elite powerlifters, the powerlifting cohort was split into 3 groups based on Wilks score: ,400 (low), 400–500 (intermediate), and .500 (high). GH ROM limitations were more pronounced in elite powerlifters (Wilks .500), who had more powerlifting experience (p = 0.048) and greater lean body mass (p = 0.040). Overall, powerlifters displayed decreased GH ROM, but increased hamstring ROM, after training programs that were heavily focused on the bench press, back squat, and deadlift.},

	abstract = {Cleather, D.J. Adjusting powerlifting performances for differences in body mass. J. Strength Cond. Res. 20(2):412–421. 2006.—It has been established that, in the sports of Olympic weightlifting (OL) and powerlifting (PL), the relationship between lifting performance and body mass is not linear. This relationship has been frequently studied in OL, but the literature on PL is less extensive. In this study, PL performance and body mass, for both men and women, was examined by using data from the International Powerlifting Federation World Championships during 1995–2004. Nonlinear regression was used to apply 7 models (including allometric, polynomial, and power models) to the data. The results of this study indicate that the relationship between PL performance and body mass can be best modeled by the equation y ϭ a Ϫ bxϪc, where y is the weight lifted (in kg) in the squat, bench press, or deadlift, x is the body mass of the lifter (in kg), and a, b, and c are constants. The constants a, b, and c are determined by the type of lift (squat, bench press, or deadlift) and the gender of the lifter and were obtained from the regression analysis. Inspection of the plots of raw residuals (actual performance minus predicted performance) vs. body mass revealed no body mass bias to this formula in contrast to research into other handicapping formulas. This study supports previous research that found a bias toward lifters in the intermediate weight categories in allometric ﬁts to PL data.},

J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000–000, 2020—Strenuous exercise has been suggested as a risk factor of pelvic floor dysfunction (PFD). Powerlifters and Olympic weightlifters compete with high external loads. To date, knowledge of PFD in these athletes has been sparse. The aim of this study was to investigate prevalence, risk factors, and bother of PFD in powerlifters and Olympic weightlifters and their knowledge of the pelvic floor muscles (PFM). All athletes aged \$18 years competing in \$1 National Championship in powerlifting or Olympic weightlifting in 2018/2019 were invited. The International Consensus on Incontinence Questionnaires were used to assess PFD. One hundred eighty women and 204 men participated. The prevalence of urinary incontinence (UI), anal incontinence (AI), and pelvic organ prolapse in women was 50.0, 80.0, and 23.3\%, respectively. Stress UI (SUI) was reported by 41.7\% of the women and 87.8\% reported a negative influence on sport performance. The prevalence of UI and AI in men was 9.3 and 61.8\%. In women, increasing body mass index was significantly associated with SUI (odds ratio [OR]: 1.09, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01–1.17) and international level of competition (OR: 3.27, 95\% CI: 1.32–8.07) and weightlifting \$4 d·wk21 (OR: 0.26, 95\% CI: 0.08–0.86) with AI. In men, increasing age (OR: 1.03, 95\% CI: 1.00–1.07) and frequently straining to void (OR: 4.84, 95\% CI: 1.02–22.94) were significantly associated with AI. Forty-three percent of the women and 74\% of the men did not know why and 44.4 and 72.5\% how to train the PFM. In conclusion, the prevalence of PFD was high, and the athletes had limited knowledge of the PFM.},

J Strength Cond Res 35(8): 2179–2186, 2021—Previous investigations of 1 repetition maximum bench press (1RM BP) performance have been either descriptive or have explored a limited number of contributing variables. The purpose of this study was to investigate the interplay between structural, technical, and neuromuscular factors in relation to 1RM BP in competitive powerlifters. Thirteen national and international level male powerlifters (26 6 9 years, 178 6 6 cm, and 93.8 6 9.9 kg) visited the laboratory twice. Anthropometric and ultrasound measures were taken on the first visit, whereas performance measures (voluntary activation level, isokinetic strength, and kinetic, kinematic, and electromyographic measurements during 1RM BP) were recorded on the second visit. Correlation and multiple regression were used to investigate the contribution of structural, technical, and neuromuscular variables to 1RM BP corrected for body mass using the Wilks coefficient. The highest degree of association was shown for structural (lean and bone mass, brachial index, arm circumference, and agonist cross-sectional area [CSA]; r 5 0.58–0.74) followed by neuromuscular factors (elbow and shoulder flexion strength; r 5 0.57–0.71), whereas technical factors did not correlate with 1RM BP performance (r \# 0.49). The multiple regression showed that lean body mass, brachial index, and isometric shoulder flexion torque predicted 59\% of the common variance in 1RM BP. These data suggest that in a sample of elite competitive powerlifters, multiple factors contribute to 1RM BP with variables such as lean body mass, the agonist CSA, brachial index, and strength of the elbow and shoulder flexors being the greatest predictors of performance.},

J Strength Cond Res 36(4): 1003–1010, 2022—The purpose of this study is: (a) provide normative performance and anthropometric data of Southern European classic powerlifters of both sexes; (b) determine the possible relationships between these variables and performance; and (c) develop population-specific predictive equations for single lifts and overall powerlifting performance. During an unofficial national-level competition, we recruited 74 athletes (51 men and 23 women) and recorded their individual, anthropometric, and performance characteristics and divided them into sex and 2 performance categories based on their Wilks points. Weaker (,370 Wilks points) and stronger (.370 Wilks points) athletes of both sexes were compared by two-way analysis of variance. Simple correlation and multiple linear regression between individual/anthropometric characteristics and performance were modeled. We applied a step-forward multiple linear regression model to predict single lifts and overall performance. All parameters significantly differed between sexes (p , 0.05 for all comparisons). Stronger male athletes had a significantly larger neck (42 6 2.8 cm; effect size [ES] 5 0.59), and flexed (40.6 6 3.3 cm; ES 5 1.18) and relaxed upper-arm (37.5 6 3.1 cm; ES 5 1.34) and thigh girths (63.6 6 7.0 cm; ES 5 0.77) compared to weaker male athletes. Furthermore, stronger women had significantly larger flexed (32.6 6 3.3 cm; ES 5 0.88) and relaxed upper-arm (33 6 1.5 cm; ES 5 2.28) and chest girths (99.3 6 9.2 cm; ES 5 1.10) compared to weaker female athletes. A combination of experience, fat mass, and upper-limb and lower-limb muscle mass indexes can accurately and precisely predict overall and individual lift performance (r2 \$ 0.83 for all the predictions). This is the first study to provide normative performance and anthropometric data in Southern European male and female powerlifters.},

Effects of different volume-equated resistance training loading strategies on muscular adaptations in well-trained men. J Strength Cond Res 28(10): 2909–2918, 2014 —Regimented resistance training has been shown to promote marked increases in skeletal muscle mass. Although muscle hypertrophy can be attained through a wide range of resistance training programs, the principle of speciﬁcity, which states that adaptations are speciﬁc to the nature of the applied stimulus, dictates that some programs will promote greater hypertrophy than others. Research is lacking, however, as to the best combination of variables required to maximize hypertophic gains. The purpose of this study was to investigate muscular adaptations to a volume-equated bodybuilding-type training program vs. a powerlifting-type routine in well-trained subjects. Seventeen young men were randomly assigned to either a hypertrophy-type resistance training group that performed 3 sets of 10 repetition maximum (RM) with 90 seconds rest or a strength-type resistance training (ST) group that performed 7 sets of 3RM with a 3-minute rest interval. After 8 weeks, no signiﬁcant differences were noted in muscle thickness of the biceps brachii. Signiﬁcant strength differences were found in favor of ST for the 1RM bench press, and a trend was found for greater increases in the 1RM squat. In conclusion, this study showed that both bodybuilding- and powerlifting-type training promote similar increases in muscular size, but powerlifting-type training is superior for enhancing maximal strength.},

Neoprene knee sleeves of varying tightness augment barbell squat one repetition maximum performance without improving other indices of muscular strength, power, or endurance. J Strength Cond Res 35(2S): S6–S15, 2021—Neoprene knee sleeves are commonly used by powerlifters and recreational users but are heavily under-researched. Furthermore, no data exist on whether knee sleeves of varying compressive tightness impact muscular performance similar to commonly used knee wraps, which are both generally effective and more so when increasingly constrictive. Fifteen resistance trained, knee sleeve naive, recreational weight lifting men (22.1 6 4.1 years; 177.5 6 5.9 cm; 87.8 6 7.8 kg) visited the laboratory on 3 separate occasions one week apart, assigned in a randomized, crossover, and counterbalanced fashion to either a minimally supportive control sleeve (CS) condition, a manufacturer-recommended sizing neoprene knee sleeve (“normal” sleeve; NS), or a one size smaller (than NS) neoprene knee sleeve (tighter sleeve [TS]). On each visit, subjects sequentially completed vertical jump (countermovement and squat jumps for both peak and mean power), one repetition maximum (1RM) barbell squat, and GymAware assessments (peak power, peak velocity, and dip) at 90\% (reported) and 100\% (tested) 1RM as well as one-leg extension (1RM, repetitions to failure, and total volume load at 75\% 1RM) tests. All data were analyzed using one-way repeated measures analysis of variance at p , 0.05. Analysis revealed a significant condition effect on barbell squat 1RM (p 5 0.003; h2 5 0.339), whereby both NS (p 5 0.044; 166 6 24 kg) and TS (p 5 0.019; 166 6 21 kg) outperformed CS (161 6 22 kg), with no difference between neoprene sleeves. Conversely, no other tested parameters differed between knee sleeve conditions (p \$ 0.05). The present results demonstrate that neoprene knee sleeves may function independent of tightness, relative to recommended sizing and ultimately unlike knee wraps. Furthermore, the singular benefits observed on barbell squat maximal strength potentially suggests an exercise-specific benefit yet to be fully elucidated.},

Effects of augmented eccentric load bench press training on one repetition maximum performance and electromyographic activity in trained powerlifters. J Strength Cond Res 35(6): 1512–1519, 2021—Augmented eccentric load (AEL) training has been shown to elicit greater lower-body muscular strength increases and faster performance improvements compared with traditional strength training. However, it is unknown whether AEL training could provide similar improvements in upper-body muscular strength. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of a 4week AEL training program on bench press one repetition maximum (1RM) strength, bar kinetics and kinematics, and surface electromyography (EMG) activity. Eight competitive powerlifters completed 5 training sessions consisting of 7 sets of a single repetition with up to 5 minutes rest between sets. Each session was completed at a predetermined AEL percentage consisting of 90\% 1RM for concentric and supramaximal loads ranging from 105 to 125\% 1RM during the eccentric phase with the use of eccentric hooks. After 4 weeks of AEL training, 1RM performance significantly increased from pretest to posttest (116.62 6 27.48–124.28 6 26.96 kg, p 5 0.001). In addition, EMG amplitude of the pectoralis major decreased during the 125\% AEL session to 59.86 6 15.36\% of pretest 1RM EMG values (p 5 0.049, effect sizes [ESs] 5 0.69). Furthermore, peak power of 1RM increased by 36.67\% from pretest to posttest (p 5 0.036, ES 5 0.58). These study findings suggest that incorporating AEL bench press training into a 4-week training cycle may be a novel strategy to improve 1RM performance in competitive powerlifters in a short period.},

Thirty-four healthy adults, including 12 powerlifters (6 women and 6 men) and 22 recreational lifters (9 women and 13 men), performed a 6–8 repetition maximum set of the bench press, while elbow and shoulder NJMs and moment arms and electromyographic (EMG) activity of 6 upper extremity muscles were recorded. The results showed that training expertise and sex affected bench press technique substantially. Powerlifters applied a different bar path which impacted joint kinematics to a greater extent and joint kinetics to a lesser extent. Specifically, powerlifters had lower normalized peak elbow NJMs and shorter joint ROMs than recreational lifters (p \# 0.05), yet no differences in normalized shoulder NJMs and muscle activity were observed. Women showed lower normalized mean shoulder NJMs, higher normalized peak elbow NJMs, and higher mean elbow to shoulder NJM ratios than men (p \# 0.05). The muscle activity of the long head of the triceps brachii and the elbow to shoulder EMG ratio were higher, yet muscle activity of the sternocostal and abdominal head of the pectoralis major was lower for female than for male subjects (p \# 0.05). In conclusion, powerlifters and men are more shoulder dominant when performing the bench press than recreational lifters and women, respectively. These findings will have implications for resistance training program design, expected training adaptations and bench press performance.},

J Strength Cond Res 34(12): 3338–3345, 2020—The purpose of this study was to quantify the effect of an overload microcycle and taper on bench press velocity and to determine if the load-velocity relationship could accurately predict 1-repetition maximum (1RM). Twelve male powerlifters participated in resistance training structured into an introduction microcycle, overload microcycle (PostOL), and taper (PostTP). At the end of each microcycle, subjects completed a bench press for 1RM assessment consisting of warm-up sets at 40, 55, 70, and 85\% of a previously established 1RM. The mean concentric velocity (MCV) was recorded during each warm-up set. A predicted 1RM (p1RM) was calculated using an individualized load-velocity profile (LVP). The average MCV decreased after PostOL (0.66 6 0.07 m·s21) compared with baseline (BL) (p 5 0.003; 0.60 6 0.11 m·s21) but increased after PostTP (0.67 6 0.09 m·s21). One-repetition maximum increased from PostOL (146.7 6 19.8 kg) to PostTP (p 5 0.002; 156.1 6 21.0 kg), with no differences observed between other test sessions (p . 0.05). Bland-Altman analysis indicated that p1RM was consistently higher than measured 1RM (3.4–7.8 kg), and the limits of agreement were extremely wide. However, very large to near perfect correlations (r 5 0.89 to 0.96) were observed between p1RM and 1RM during BL, PostOL, and PostTP. The load-velocity relationship established from submaximal sets did not accurately predict 1RM, but MCV was affected by changes in weekly training loads. Velocity-based measurements seem to be more sensitive to changes in training loads than maximal strength.},

Twenty experienced resistance-trained men (age 5 25.5 6 3.2 years; body mass 5 86.9 6 12.4 kg; body height 5 178.0 6 5.3 cm) were tested for deadlift 1 repetition maximum (1RM), countermovement jump (CMJ), peak force (PF), and rate of force development (pRFD20) produced at isometric MTP and isometric MSP. Subjects were also assessed for architecture of vastus lateralis (VL). Physiological muscle thickness, pennation angle, and fascicle length (FL) were measured. Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the relationships between variables. In addition, differences between MTP and MSP were assessed using paired-sample t-tests. A significant (p , 0.05) difference was detected on the correlation between deadlift 1RM and MSP (r 5 0.78; p , 0.001) compared with MTP (r 5 0.55; p 5 0.012). Moderate correlations were observed between MSP PF and VLFL (r 5 0.55; p 5 0.011). Midshin pull pRFD20 was the only parameter significantly correlated with CMJ (r 5 0.50; p 5 0.048). Significantly higher PF and pRFD20 were recorded in MTP compared with MSP (p 5 0.007 and p 5 0.003, respectively). The present results show that force produced from the floor position may be more important than force produced from a position that mimics the second pull of the clean for deadlift and vertical jump performances. Coaches and scientific investigators should consider using MSP to assess isometric PF using a test correlated with both muscle architecture and dynamic performances.},

However, clinical data on their efﬁcacy are limited. The purpose of this study was to examine whether kettlebell training transfers strength and power to weightlifting and powerlifting exercises and improves muscular endurance. Thirty-seven subjects were assigned to an experimental (EXP, n = 23; mean age = 40.9 6 12.9 years) or a control group (CON; n = 14; mean age = 39.6 6 15.8 years), range 18–72 years. The participants were required to perform assessments including a barbell clean and jerk, barbell bench press, maximal vertical jump, and 458 back extensions to volitional fatigue before and after a 10-week kettlebell training program. Training was structured in a group setting for 2 d\$wk21 for 10 weeks. A repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted to determine group 3 time interactions and main effects. Post hoc pairwise comparisons were conducted when appropriate. Bench press revealed a time 3 group interaction and a main effect (p , 0.05). Clean and jerk and back extension demonstrated a trend toward a time 3 group interaction, but it did not reach signiﬁcance (p = 0.053). However, clean and jerk did reveal a main effect for time (p , 0.05). No signiﬁcant ﬁndings were reported for maximal vertical jump. The results demonstrate a transfer of power and strength in response to 10 weeks of training with kettlebells. Traditional training methods may not be convenient or accessible for strength and conditioning specialists, athletes, coaches, and recreational exercisers. The current data suggest that kettlebells may be an effective alternative tool to improve performance in weightlifting and powerlifting.},

Six male powerlifters (POW) (height: 179.2 6 7.8 cm; mass: 87.1 6 8.0 kg; age: 21–33 years) of international level, 6 male Olympic weightlifters (OLY) (height: 176.7 6 7.7 cm; mass: 83.1 6 13 kg; age: 22–30 years) of national level, and 6 recreationally trained male athletes (height: 181.9 6 8.7 cm; mass: 87.9 6 15.3 kg; age: 23–33 years) performed the LBBS, HBBS, and both LBBS and HBBS (respectively) up to and including 100\% 1RM. Small to moderate (d = 0.2–0.5) effect size differences were observed between the POW and OLY in joint angles and Fv, although none were statistically signiﬁcant. However, signiﬁcant joint angle results were observed between the experienced POW/OLY and the recreationally trained group. Our ﬁndings suggest that practitioners seeking to place emphasis on the stronger hip musculature should consider the LBBS. Also, when the goal is to lift the greatest load possible, the LBBS may be preferable. Conversely, the HBBS is more suited to replicate movements that exhibit a more upright torso position, such as the snatch and clean, or to place more emphasis on the associated musculature of the knee joint.},

The purpose of this study was to examine concentric and eccentric force-velocity relationships of the knee extensors of 30 young, healthy females at seven velocities between 30 and 2lO0/secusing the Kinetic Communicator. The average force produced by the quadriceps during three concentric and three eccentric contractions was calculated at each velocity. The force-velocity relationships were graphed and analyzed using linear regression techniques. Results showed that the mean slope of the combined linear regression lines of concentric data was -0.55, which is significantly different from a zero slope. This indicates that concentric force of the knee extensors decreases as velocity increases. The mean slope of the combined linear regression lines of the eccentric data was -0.04, indicating no significant change in eccentric force with an increase in velocity. It appears, therefore, that in the knee extensors of healthy, young females, concentric force decreases as velocity increases to 210°/ sec, while eccentric force remains the same. Both concentric and eccentric work are often emphasized in strength training programs. It is, therefore, important for professionals involved in the rehabilitation or training of patients and athletes to be aware of differences between eccentric and concentric force-velocity relationships.},

Mechanical performance of a muscle is often assessed by the muscle’s ability to shorten and generate power over a range of loads or forces, characterized by the force–velocity and force–power relationships. The hyperbolic force–velocity relationship of muscle, for a long time, has been regarded as a pure empirical description of the force–velocity data. Connections between mechanical manifestation in terms of force–velocity properties and the kinetics of the crossbridge cycle have only been established recently. In this review, we describe how the model of Huxley’s crossbridge kinetics can be transformed to the hyperbolic Hill equation, and link the changes in force–velocity properties to molecular events within the crossbridge cycle driven by ATP hydrolysis. This allows us to reinterpret some findings from previous studies on experimental interventions that altered the force–velocity relationship and gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms of muscle contraction under physiological and pathophysiological conditions.},

Hill over seven decades ago to illustrate the relationship between shortening velocity and load is still the predominant method used to characterize muscle performance, even though it has been regarded as purely empirical and lacking precision in predicting velocities at high and low loads. Popularity of the Hill equation has been sustained perhaps because of historical reasons, but its simplicity is certainly attractive. The descriptive nature of the equation does not diminish its role as a useful tool in our quest to understand animal locomotion and optimal design of muscle-powered devices like bicycles. In this Review, an analysis is presented to illustrate the connection between the historic Hill equation and the kinetics of myosin cross-bridge cycle based on the latest findings on myosin motor interaction with actin filaments within the structural confines of a sarcomere. In light of the new data and perspective, some previous studies of force–velocity relations of muscle are revisited to further our understanding of muscle mechanics and the underlying biochemical events, specifically how extracellular and intracellular environment, protein isoform expression, and posttranslational modification of contractile and regulatory proteins change the interaction between myosin and actin that in turn alter muscle force, shortening velocity, and the relationship between them.},

	abstract = {Background  Although performance of the Nordic hamstring exercise (NHE) has been shown to elicit adaptations that may reduce hamstring strain injury (HSI) risk and occurrence, compliance in NHE interventions in professional soccer teams is low despite a high occurrence of HSI in soccer. A possible reason for low compliance is the high dosages prescribed within the recommended interventions. The aim of this review was to investigate the effect of NHE-training volume on eccentric hamstring strength and biceps femoris fascicle length adaptations.
Methods  A literature search was conducted using the SPORTDiscus, Ovid, and PubMed databases. A total of 293 studies were identified prior to application of the following inclusion criteria: (1) a minimum of 4 weeks of NHE training was completed; (2) mean ± standard deviation (SD) pre- and post-intervention were provided for the measured variables to allow for secondary analysis; and (3) biceps femoris muscle architecture was measured, which resulted in 13 studies identified for further analysis. The TESTEX criteria were used to assess the quality of studies with risk of bias assessment assessed using a fail-safe N (Rosenthal method). Consistency of studies was analysed using I2 as a test of heterogeneity and secondary analysis of studies included Hedges’ g effect sizes for strength and muscle architecture variables to provide comparison within studies, between-study differences were estimated using a random-effects model.
Results  A range of scores (3–11 out of 15) from the TESTEX criteria were reported, showing variation in study quality. A ‘low risk of bias’ was observed in the randomized controlled trials included, with no study bias shown for both strength or architecture (N = 250 and 663, respectively; p {\textless} 0.001). Study consistency was moderate to high for strength (I2 = 62.49\%) and muscle architecture (I2 = 88.03\%). Within-study differences showed that following interventions of ≥ 6 weeks, very large positive effect sizes were seen in eccentric strength following both high volume (g = 2.12) and low volume (g = 2.28) NHE interventions. Similar results were reported for changes in fascicle length (g ≥ 2.58) and a large-to-very large positive reduction in pennation angle (g ≥ 1.31). Between-study differences were estimated to be at a magnitude of 0.374 (p = 0.009) for strength and 0.793 (p {\textless} 0.001) for architecture.
Conclusions  Reducing NHE volume prescription does not negatively affect adaptations in eccentric strength and muscle architecture when compared with high dose interventions. These findings suggest that lower volumes of NHE may be more appropriate for athletes, with an aim to increase intervention compliance, potentially reducing the risk of HSI.},

Although the worldwide interest in the Buteyko method, there is a paucity of studies gathering evidence to support its use. Therefore, we aim to conduct a systematic review and meta-­analysis to assess the effects of the Buteyko method in children and adults with asthma. Methods and analysis  We will search on Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register  ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for studies focusing on the Buteyko method for children and adults with asthma. The searches will be carried out in September 2021 from database’s inception to the present. We will include randomised controlled trials comparing Buteyko method alone with asthma education or inactive control intervention. There will be no restriction on language. Primary outcomes include quality of life, asthma symptoms and adverse events/side effects. Two review authors will independently screen the studies for inclusion and extract data. We will assess the quality of the included studies using the ‘Risk of Bias’ tool. The certainty of the evidence will be assessed using the GRADE approach. Data synthesis will be conducted using Review Manager software. Reporting of the review will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-­Analyses guidance and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Ethics and dissemination  This study will assess and provide evidence for the use of the Buteyko method in people with asthma. We will analyse secondary data and this does not require ethics approval. The findings will be published in peer-­reviewed journals, at relevant conferences and will be shared in plain language in social media. Moreover, the findings of this review could guide the direction of healthcare practice and research. PROSPERO registration number  CRD42020193132.},

            Physical activity decreases the risk of a network of diseases, and exercise may be prescribed as medicine for lifestyle-related disorders such as type 2 diabetes, dementia, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. During the past couple of decades, it has been apparent that skeletal muscle works as an endocrine organ, which can produce and secrete hundreds of myokines that exert their effects in either autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine manners. Recent advances show that skeletal muscle produces myokines in response to exercise, which allow for crosstalk between the muscle and other organs, including brain, adipose tissue, bone, liver, gut, pancreas, vascular bed, and skin, as well as communication within the muscle itself. Although only few myokines have been allocated to a specific function in humans, it has been identified that the biological roles of myokines include effects on, for example, cognition, lipid and glucose metabolism, browning of white fat, bone formation, endothelial cell function, hypertrophy, skin structure, and tumor growth. This suggests that myokines may be useful biomarkers for monitoring exercise prescription for people with, for example, cancer, diabetes, or neurodegenerative diseases.},

Historically, the coupling between muscle and bone has been viewed in light of mechanotransduction, which dictates that the mechanical forces applied to muscle are transmitted to the skeleton to initiate bone formation. However, these organs also communicate through the endocrine system, orchestrated by a family of cytokines namely myokines (derived from myocytes) and osteokines (derived from bone cells). A third player in this biochemical crosstalk is adipose tissue and the secretion of adipokines (derived from adipocytes). In this review, we discuss the bidirectional effects of myokines and osteokines on muscle and bone metabolism, and the impact of adipokines on both of these secretory organs.},

We review cellular and molecular processes involved in injury and repair of skeletal muscle with regard to the amount and location of damage produced. Discussion is based on advances made by use of newer techniques, including immunochemistry, in situ hybridization, molecular biology, ultrastructural analysis, and cell culture. Damage and repair processes after eccentric work, stretch, overload, chronic stimulation, cold injury, and other models are discussed for cellular and molecular components. Hypertrophy or hyperplasia can occur under certain conditions. After injury, satellite cells are activated by growth factors. These cells can also be activated during fiber-type transformation, probably to provide necessary DNA content rather than to supply cells of a new lineage. Emphasis is given to myosin mRNA studied by in situ hybridization to localize subcellular distribution. Increases in mRNA concentration are found near nuclei in damaged regions and at the subcellular sites being repaired in the middle of skeletal muscle fibers or near the myotendon junction. The activation of genes for muscle regulatory factors during development is compared with their activation in regeneration and response to injury.

            Ribosomes are the macromolecular engines of protein synthesis. Skeletal muscle ribosome biogenesis is stimulated by exercise, but the contribution of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) copy number and methylation to exercise-induced rDNA transcription is unclear. To investigate the genetic and epigenetic regulation of ribosome biogenesis with exercise, a time course of skeletal muscle biopsies was obtained from 30 participants (18 men and 12 women; 31 ±8 yrs, 25 ±4 kg/m
            2
            ) at rest and 30 min, 3h, 8h, and 24h after acute endurance (n=10, 45 min cycling, 70\% VO
            2
            max) or resistance exercise (n=10, 4 x 7 x 2 exercises); 10 control participants underwent biopsies without exercise. rDNA transcription and dosage were assessed using qPCR and whole genome sequencing. rDNA promoter methylation was investigated using massARRAY EpiTYPER, and global rDNA CpG methylation was assessed using reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing. Ribosome biogenesis and
            MYC
            transcription were associated with resistance but not endurance exercise, indicating preferential up-regulation during hypertrophic processes. With resistance exercise, ribosome biogenesis was associated with rDNA gene dosage as well as epigenetic changes in enhancer and non-canonical MYC-associated areas in rDNA, but not the promoter. A mouse model of
            in vivo
            metabolic RNA labeling and genetic myonuclear fluorescent labeling validated the effects of an acute hypertrophic stimulus on ribosome biogenesis and
            Myc
            transcription, and corroborated rDNA enhancer and Myc-associated methylation alterations specifically in myonuclei. This study provides the first information on skeletal muscle genetic and rDNA gene-wide epigenetic regulation of ribosome biogenesis in response to exercise, revealing novel roles for rDNA dosage and CpG methylation.

	abstract = {The attachment between tendon and bone occurs across a complex transitional tissue that minimizes stress concentrations and allows for load transfer between muscles and skeleton. This unique tissue cannot be reconstructed following injury, leading to high incidence of recurrent failure and stressing the need for new clinical approaches. This review describes the current understanding of the development and function of the attachment site between tendon and bone. The embryonic attachment unit, namely, the tip of the tendon and the bone eminence into which it is inserted, was recently shown to develop modularly from a unique population of Sox9- and Scxpositive cells, which are distinct from tendon fibroblasts and chondrocytes. The fate and differentiation of these cells is regulated by transforming growth factor beta and bone morphogenetic protein signaling, respectively. Muscle loads are then necessary for the tissue to mature and mineralize. Mineralization of the attachment unit, which occurs postnatally at most sites, is largely controlled by an Indian hedgehog/parathyroid hormone-related protein feedback loop. A number of fundamental questions regarding the development of this remarkable attachment system require further study. These relate to the signaling mechanism that facilitates the formation of an interface with a gradient of cellular and extracellular phenotypes, as well as to the interactions between tendon and bone at the point of attachment.},

Physiol Rev 84: 209–238, 2004; 10.1152/physrev.00019.2003.—Under normal circumstances, mammalian adult skeletal muscle is a stable tissue with very little turnover of nuclei. However, upon injury, skeletal muscle has the remarkable ability to initiate a rapid and extensive repair process preventing the loss of muscle mass. Skeletal muscle repair is a highly synchronized process involving the activation of various cellular responses. The initial phase of muscle repair is characterized by necrosis of the damaged tissue and activation of an inflammatory response. This phase is rapidly followed by activation of myogenic cells to proliferate, differentiate, and fuse leading to new myofiber formation and reconstitution of a functional contractile apparatus. Activation of adult muscle satellite cells is a key element in this process. Muscle satellite cell activation resembles embryonic myogenesis in several ways including the de novo induction of the myogenic regulatory factors. Signaling factors released during the regenerating process have been identified, but their functions remain to be fully defined. In addition, recent evidence supports the possible contribution of adult stem cells in the muscle regeneration process. In particular, bone marrow-derived and muscle-derived stem cells contribute to new myofiber formation and to the satellite cell pool after injury.},

	abstract = {Myonuclei gained during exercise-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy may be long-lasting and could facilitate future muscle adaptability after deconditioning, a concept colloquially termed “muscle memory.” The evidence for this is limited, mostly due to the lack of a murine exercise-training paradigm that is nonsurgical and reversible. To address this limitation, we developed a novel progressive weighted-wheel-running (PoWeR) model of murine exercise training to test whether myonuclei gained during exercise persist after detraining. We hypothesized that myonuclei acquired during training-induced hypertrophy would remain following loss of muscle mass with detraining. Singly housed female C57BL/6J mice performed 8 wk of PoWeR, while another group performed 8 wk of PoWeR followed by 12 wk of detraining. Age-matched sedentary cage-dwelling mice served as untrained controls. Eight weeks of PoWeR yielded significant plantaris muscle fiber hypertrophy, a shift to a more oxidative phenotype, and greater myonuclear density than untrained mice. After 12 wk of detraining, the plantaris muscle returned to an untrained phenotype with fewer myonuclei. A finding of fewer myonuclei simultaneously with plantaris deconditioning argues against a muscle memory mechanism mediated by elevated myonuclear density in primarily fast-twitch muscle. PoWeR is a novel, practical, and easy-to-deploy approach for eliciting robust hypertrophy in mice, and our findings can inform future research on the mechanisms underlying skeletal muscle adaptive potential and muscle memory.},

As the gut microbiome is implicated in colitis, we hypothesized that VWR and FTR would differentially affect the gut microbiome. Mice (9-10/treatment) were randomly assigned to VWR, FTR, or sedentary home cage control (SED) for 6 wk. VWR were given running wheel access, whereas FTR ran on a treadmill for 40 min/day at 8–12 m/min, 5\% grade. Forty-eight hours after the last exercise session, DNA was isolated from the fecal pellets and cecal contents, and the conserved bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced using the Illumina Miseq platform. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance based on weighted UniFrac distance matrix revealed different bacterial clusters between feces and cecal contents in all groups ( P {\textless} 0.01). Interestingly, the community structures of the three treatment groups clustered separately from each other in both gut regions ( P {\textless} 0.05). Contrary to our hypothesis, the α-diversity metric, Chao1, indicated that VWR led to reduced bacterial richness compared with FTR or SED ( P {\textless} 0.05). Taxonomic evaluation revealed that both VWR and FTR altered many individual bacterial taxa. Of particular interest, Turicibacter spp., which has been strongly associated with immune function and bowel disease, was significantly lower in VWR vs. SED/FTR. These data indicate that VWR and FTR differentially alter the intestinal microbiome of mice. These effects were observed in both the feces and cecum despite vastly different community structures between each intestinal region.},

We aimed to elucidate the time course of myonuclear dynamics during endurance training, loaded and concentric resistance training, and nerve silencing-induced disuse atrophy with subsequent recovery. We modiﬁed tibialis anterior muscle activity in free-living rats with electrical stimulation from implantable pulse generators, or with implantable osmotic pumps delivering tetrodotoxin (TTX) to silence the motor nerve without transection. We used the updated, automated software MyoVision to measure ﬁber-type-speciﬁc responses in whole tibialis anterior cross sections (\$8,000 ﬁbers each). Seven days of continuous low-frequency stimulation (CLFS) reduced muscle mass (À12\%), increased slower myosin isoforms and reduced IIX/IIB ﬁbers (À32\%), and substantially increased myonuclei especially in IIX/IIB ﬁbers (55.5\%). High-load resistance training (spillover) produced greater hypertrophy (\$16\%) in muscle mass and ﬁber cross-sectional area (CSA) than low-load resistance training (concentric, \$6\%) and was associated with myonuclear addition in all ﬁber types (35\%–46\%). TTX-induced nerve silencing resulted in progressive loss in muscle mass, ﬁber CSA, and myonuclei per ﬁber cross section (À50.7\%, À53.7\%, and À40.7\%, respectively, at 14 days). Myonuclear loss occurred in a ﬁber-type-independent manner, but subsequent recovery during voluntary habitual activity suggested that type IIX/IIB ﬁbers contained more new myonuclei during recovery from severe atrophy. This study demonstrates the power and accuracy provided by the updated MyoVision software and introduces new models for studying myonuclear dynamics in training, detraining, retraining, repeated disuse, and recovery.},

While the initiating physiological event leading to atrophy seems to be the loss of muscle tension and a good deal of the physiology of muscle atrophy has been characterized, little is known about the triggers or the molecular signaling events underlying this process. Decreases in protein synthesis and increases in protein degradation both have been shown to contribute to muscle protein loss due to disuse, and recent work has delineated elements of both synthetic and proteolytic processes underlying muscle atrophy. It is also becoming evident that interactions among known proteolytic pathways (ubiquitin-proteasome, lysosomal, and calpain) are involved in muscle proteolysis during atrophy. Factors such as TNF-α, glucocorticoids, myostatin, and reactive oxygen species can induce muscle protein loss under specified conditions. Also, it is now apparent that the transcription factor NF-κB is a key intracellular signal transducer in disuse atrophy. Transcriptional profiles of atrophying muscle show both up- and downregulation of various genes over time, thus providing further evidence that there are multiple concurrent processes involved in muscle atrophy. The purpose of this review is to synthesize our current understanding of the molecular regulation of muscle atrophy. We also discuss how ongoing work should uncover more about the molecular underpinnings of muscle wasting, particularly that due to disuse.},

	abstract = {Background In the context of mass regulation, ‘muscle memory’ can be deﬁned as long‐lasting cellular adaptations to hypertrophic exercise training that persist during detraining‐induced atrophy and may facilitate future adaptation. The cellular basis of muscle memory is not clearly deﬁned but may be related to myonuclear number and/or epigenetic changes within muscle ﬁbres.
Methods Utilizing progressive weighted wheel running (PoWeR), a novel murine exercise training model, we explored myonuclear dynamics and skeletal muscle miRNA levels with training and detraining utilizing immunohistochemistry, single ﬁbre myonuclear analysis, and quantitative analysis of miRNAs. We also used a genetically inducible mouse model of ﬂuorescent myonuclear labelling to study myonuclear adaptations early during exercise.
Results In the soleus, oxidative type 2a ﬁbres were larger after 2 months of PoWeR (P = 0.02), but muscle ﬁbre size and myonuclear number did not return to untrained levels after 6 months of detraining. Soleus type 1 ﬁbres were not larger after PoWeR but had signiﬁcantly more myonuclei, as well as central nuclei (P {\textless} 0.0001), the latter from satellite cell‐derived or resident myonuclei, appearing early during training and remaining with detraining. In the gastrocnemius muscle, oxidative type 2a ﬁbres of the deep region were larger and contained more myonuclei after PoWeR (P {\textless} 0.003), both of which returned to untrained levels after detraining. In the gastrocnemius and plantaris, two muscles where myonuclear number was comparable with untrained levels after 6 months of detraining, myonuclei were signiﬁcantly elongated with detraining (P {\textless} 0.0001). In the gastrocnemius, miR‐1 was lower with training and remained lower after detraining (P {\textless} 0.002).
Conclusions This study found that (i) myonuclei gained during hypertrophy are lost with detraining across muscles, even in oxidative ﬁbres; (ii) complete reversal of muscle adaptations, including myonuclear number, to untrained levels occurs within 6 months in the plantaris and gastrocnemius; (iii) the murine soleus is resistant to detraining; (iv) myonuclear accretion occurs early with wheel running and can be uncoupled from muscle ﬁbre hypertrophy; (v) resident (non‐satellite cell‐derived) myonuclei can adopt a central location; (vi) myonuclei change shape with training and detraining; and (vii) miR‐1 levels may reﬂect a memory of previous adaptation that facilitates future growth.},

	url = {https://uknowledge.uky.edu/physiology_etds/57/},
	abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that the gut microbiome could play a role in skeletal muscle plasticity, providing novel treatments for muscle wasting diseases and/or performance enhancements. I first sought to determine if the gut microbiome is necessary for skeletal muscle adaptation to exercise. Forty-two, four-month old, female C57Bl/6J underwent nine weeks of weighted wheel running or remained in cage with a locked wheel, without or without the administration of antibiotics (treated). In response to wheel running, I found that antibiotic depletion of the microbiome led to a blunted hypertrophic response in the soleus muscle as measured by normalized muscle wet weight and mean and fiber-type specific cross-sectional area (CSA). The plantaris muscle of mice who ran with antibiotic-induced dysbiosis showed a blunted glycolytic to oxidative fiber-type shift, decreased myonuclear accretion and satellite cell abundance compared to non-treated runners. These results are the first to demonstrate that an intact microbiome is necessary for skeletal muscle adaption to exercise.

I next tested if the gut microbiome mitigates skeletal muscle atrophy induced by hind limb immobilization. Eighteen, four-month old, female C57Bl/6J mice were divided into two groups (n=9/group), that received cecal microbial transfers from either exercise-trained or sedentary donors. After four weeks of cecal transplants, the recipient mice underwent 10-days of single leg hind-limb immobilization. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that the recipients of the exercise-trained donors experienced significantly less skeletal muscle atrophy of the soleus muscle, as measures by mean fiber and fiber-type specific CSA. The transfer of microbiome from exercise-trained donors also led to a preservation of Type-2A fibers in the immobilized soleus muscle. These results demonstrated that the transfer of a microbiome from an exercise-trained host into recipients mitigated skeletal muscle atrophy, in addition to the persevering Type-2A fibers abundance during atrophy

To better understand how the gut microbiome acts to modulate skeletal muscle mass and fiber-type composition, metagenomic sequencing was performed on donor and recipient of exercise-trained and sedentary cecal content. Sequencing data revealed significant differences in the microbiome between the two recipient groups. Further microbial functional comparisons were made and distinguished significant associations in fucose degradation and histidine metabolism in the recipients who received microbiome from exercised-trained donors. To further interrogate the metagenomic sequencing, microbial sequence features were analyzed with MelonnPan to determine predictive metabolites associated with each recipient group. Lipids and bile acids metabolites were significantly associated with the recipients of the exercise-trained donors. There was a trend for imidazole propionate to be associated with the recipients of the exercise-trained donors. The metagenomic analysis indicated the microbiome from an exercise-trained host was associated with metabolic pathways that generate short chain fatty acids (fucose degradation) and the histidine-derived metabolite imidazole propionate.

The results from this dissertation provide evidence of crosstalk between skeletal muscle and the gut microbiome, providing for the first-time data that demonstrates the gut microbiome influences both anabolic and catabolic signaling in skeletal muscle. Although a direct mechanism for the skeletal muscle-gut microbiome interaction was not found, the metabolites propionate and imidazole propionate were identified as possible candidate for future studies. A general conclusion from the two studies described in this dissertation provides new evidence for the regulation of skeletal muscle mass and fiber-type composition.

Future work will need to focus on the identification of the gut microbial-derived metabolites promote anabolic pathways in skeletal muscle. Additional studies should also determine if the attenuation in atrophy induced by hind limb immobilization is conserved in other models of atrophy as observed with skeletal muscle wasting diseases and space exploration.},

Acute one-legged exercise decreased (P{\textless}0.01) lipidation of microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) (ß50\%) and the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio (ß60\%) indicating that content of autophagosomes decreases with exercise in human muscle. The decrease in LC3-II/LC3-I ratio did not correlate with activation of 5 AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) trimer complexes in human muscle. Consistently, pharmacological AMPK activation with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside (AICAR) in mouse muscle did not affect the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio. Four hours after exercise, insulin further reduced (P{\textless}0.01) the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio (ß80\%) in muscle of the exercised and non-exercised leg in humans. This coincided with increased Ser-757 phosphorylation of Unc51 like kinase 1 (ULK1), which is suggested as a mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) target. Accordingly, inhibition of mTOR signalling in mouse muscle prevented the ability of insulin to reduce the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio. In response to 3 weeks of one-legged exercise training, the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio decreased (P{\textless}0.05) in both trained and untrained muscle and this change was largely driven by an increase in LC3-I content. Taken together, acute exercise and insulin stimulation reduce muscle autophagosome content, while exercise training may increase the capacity for formation of autophagosomes in muscle. Moreover, AMPK activation during exercise may not be sufﬁcient to regulate autophagy in muscle, while mTORC1 signalling via ULK1 probably mediates the autophagy-inhibiting effect of insulin.},

The central role of the vascular endothelial cell in modulating both perfusion and transendothelial insulin and nutrient transport is also reviewed. The relationship between muscle metabolic insulin resistance and the vascular action of insulin in muscle continues to indicate an important role for the microvasculature as a target for insulin action and that impairing insulin's microvascular action significantly affects body glucose metabolism.},

	abstract = {Skeletal muscle shows an enormous plasticity to adapt to stimuli such as contractile activity (endurance exercise, electrical stimulation, denervation), loading conditions (resistance training, microgravity), substrate supply (nutritional interventions) or environmental factors (hypoxia). The presented data show that adaptive structural events occur in both muscle fibres (myofibrils, mitochondria) and associated structures (motoneurons and capillaries). Functional adaptations appear to involve alterations in regulatory mechanisms (neuronal, endocrine and intracellular signalling), contractile properties and metabolic capacities. With the appropriate molecular techniques it has been demonstrated over the past 10 years that rapid changes in skeletal muscle mRNA expression occur with exercise in human and rodent species. Recently, gene expression profiling analysis has demonstrated that transcriptional adaptations in skeletal muscle due to changes in loading involve a broad range of genes and that mRNA changes often run parallel for genes in the same functional categories. These changes can be matched to the structural/functional adaptations known to occur with corresponding stimuli. Several signalling pathways involving cytoplasmic protein kinases and nuclear-encoded transcription factors are recognized as potential master regulators that transduce physiological stress into transcriptional adaptations of batteries of metabolic and contractile genes. Nuclear reprogramming is recognized as an important event in muscle plasticity and may be related to the adaptations in the myosin type, protein turnover, and the cytoplasma-to-myonucleus ratio. The accessibility of muscle tissue to biopsies in conjunction with the advent of high-throughput gene expression analysis technology points to skeletal muscle plasticity as a particularly useful paradigm for studying gene regulatory phenomena in humans.},

	abstract = {The transcriptional demands of skeletal muscle fibres are high and require hundreds of nuclei (myonuclei) to produce specialised contractile machinery and multiple mitochondria along their length. Each myonucleus spatially regulates gene expression in a finite volume of cytoplasm, termed the myonuclear domain (MND), which positively correlates with fibre cross‐sectional area (CSA). Endurance training triggers adaptive responses in skeletal muscle, including myonuclear accretion, decreased MND sizes and increased expression of the transcription co‐activator peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor‐γ coactivator‐1α (PGC‐1α). Previous work has shown that overexpression of PGC‐1α in skeletal muscle regulates mitochondrial biogenesis, myonuclear accretion and MND volume. However, whether PGC‐1α is critical for these processes in adaptation to endurance training remained unclear. To test this, we evaluated myonuclear distribution and organisation in endurance‐trained wild‐type mice and mice lacking PGC‐1α in skeletal muscle (PGC1α mKO). Here, we show a differential myonuclear accretion response to endurance training that is governed by PGC‐1α and is dependent on muscle fibre size. The positive relationship of MND size and muscle fibre CSA trended towards a stronger correlation in PGC‐1a mKO versus control after endurance training, suggesting that myonuclear accretion was slightly affected with increasing fibre CSA in PGC‐1α mKO. However, in larger fibres, the relationship between MND and CSA was significantly altered in trained versus sedentary PGC‐1α mKO, suggesting that PGC‐1α is critical for myonuclear accretion in these fibres. Accordingly, there was a negative correlation between the nuclear number and CSA, suggesting that in larger fibres myonuclear numbers fail to scale with CSA. Our findings suggest that PGC‐1α is an important contributor to myonuclear accretion following moderate‐intensity endurance training. This may contribute to the adaptive response to endurance training by enabling a sufficient rate of transcription of genes required for mitochondrial biogenesis.},

	abstract = {Muscle ﬁbers are syncytial postmitotic cells that can acquire exogenous nuclei from resident muscle stem cells, called satellite cells. Myonuclei are added to muscle ﬁbers by satellite cells during conditions such as load-induced hypertrophy. It is difﬁcult to dissect the molecular contributions of resident versus satellite cell-derived myonuclei during adaptation due to the complexity of labeling distinct nuclear populations in multinuclear cells without label transference between nuclei. To sidestep this barrier, we used a genetic mouse model where myonuclear DNA can be speciﬁcally and stably labeled via nonconstitutive H2B-GFP at any point in the lifespan. Resident myonuclei (Mn) were GFP-tagged in vivo before 8 wk of progressive weighted wheel running (PoWeR) in adult mice ({\textgreater}4-mo-old). Resident þ satellite cell-derived myonuclei (Mn þ SC Mn) were labeled at the end of PoWeR in a separate cohort. Following myonuclear isolation, promoter DNA methylation proﬁles acquired with low-input reduced representation bisulﬁte sequencing (RRBS) were compared to deduce epigenetic contributions of satellite cell-derived myonuclei during adaptation. Resident myonuclear DNA has hypomethylated promoters in genes related to protein turnover, whereas the addition of satellite cell-derived myonuclei shifts myonuclear methylation proﬁles to favor transcription factor regulation and cellcell signaling. By comparing myonucleus-speciﬁc methylation proﬁling to previously published single-nucleus transcriptional analysis in the absence (Mn) versus the presence of satellite cells (Mn þ SC Mn) with PoWeR, we provide evidence that satellite cellderived myonuclei may preferentially supply speciﬁc ribosomal proteins to growing myoﬁbers and retain an epigenetic “memory” of prior stem cell identity. These data offer insights on distinct epigenetic myonuclear characteristics and contributions during adult muscle growth.},

Design: Cross-sectional/longitudinal. Setting: University. Participants: Fifty-six men aged 20 to 42 years. Independent Variables: Non–resistance-trained (C) or resistance-trained (RT), RT currently using AAS (RT-AS), of which if AAS usage ceased for \$18 weeks resampled as Returning Participants (RP) or RT previously using AAS (PREV). Main Outcome Measures: Myonuclei per fiber and cross-sectional area (CSA) of trapezius muscle fibers. Results: There were no significant differences between C (n 5 5), RT (n 5 15), RT-AS (n 5 17), and PREV (n 5 6) for myonuclei per fiber. Three of 5 returning participants (RP1-3) were biopsied twice. Before visit 1, RP1 ceased AAS usage 34 weeks before, RP2 and RP3 ceased AAS usage \#2 weeks before, and all had 28 weeks between visits. Fiber CSA decreased for RP1 and RP2 between visits (7566 vs 6629 mm2; 7854 vs 5677 mm2) while myonuclei per fiber remained similar (3.5 vs 3.4; 2.5 vs 2.6). Respectively, these values increased for RP3 between visits (7167 vs 7889 mm2; 2.6 vs 3.3). Conclusions: This cohort of past AAS users did not have elevated myonuclei per fiber values, unlike previous research, but reported AAS usage was much lower. Training and AAS usage history also varied widely among participants. Comparable myonuclei per fiber numbers despite decrements in fiber CSA postexposure adheres with the muscle memory mechanism, but there is variation in usage relative to sampling date and low numbers of returning participants.},

	abstract = {Skeletal muscle is a plastic tissue that adapts to exercise through fusion of muscle stem cells (MuSCs) with myofibers, a physiological process referred to as myonuclear accretion. However, it is still unclear whether myonuclear accretion is driven by increased mechanical loading per se, or occurs, at least in part, in response to exercise-induced muscle injury. Here, we developed a carefully monitored and individualized neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) training protocol of the mouse plantar flexor muscles. Each NMES training session consisted of 80 isometric contractions at a submaximal mechanical intensity ∼ corresponding to 15\% of maximal tetanic force to avoid muscle damage. NMES trained mice were stimulated for 2 × 3 consecutive days separated by one day of rest, for a total of 6 sessions. Experiments were conducted on C57BL/6J and BALB/c males at 10-12 weeks of age. NMES led to a robust myonuclear accretion and higher MuSC content in gastrocnemius muscle of both mouse lines, without overt signs of muscle damage/regeneration or muscle hypertrophy or force improvement. This new mouse model of myonuclear accretion relying on the main function of skeletal muscles, i.e., force production in response to electrical stimuli, will be of utmost interest to further understand the role of MuSCs in skeletal muscle adaptations.},

	abstract = {Satellite cells support adult skeletal muscle fiber adaptations to loading in numerous ways. The fusion of satellite cells, driven by cell-a­ utonomous and/or extrinsic factors, contributes new myonuclei to muscle fibers, associates with load-­induced hypertrophy, and may support focal membrane damage repair and long-t­ erm myonuclear transcriptional output. Recent studies have also revealed that satellite cells communicate within their niche to mediate muscle remodeling in response to resistance exercise, regulating the activity of numerous cell types through various mechanisms such as secretory signaling and cell–c­ ell contact. Muscular adaptation to resistance and endurance activity can be initiated and sustained for a period of time in the absence of satellite cells, but satellite cell participation is ultimately required to achieve full adaptive potential, be it growth, function, or proprioceptive coordination. While significant progress has been made in understanding the roles of satellite cells in adult muscle over the last few decades, many conclusions have been extrapolated from regeneration studies. This review highlights our current understanding of satellite cell behavior and contributions to adaptation outside of regeneration in adult muscle, as well as the roles of satellite cells beyond fusion and myonuclear accretion, which are gaining broader recognition.},

In this investigation, the mechanisms involved in skeletal muscle mass regulation—especially those associated with proteosynthesis and with the production of new organelles—are presented. Thus, the critical roles of mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway and its regulators are reviewed. In addition, the importance of ribosome biogenesis, satellite cells involvement, myonuclear accretion, and some major epigenetic modiﬁcations related to protein synthesis are discussed. Furthermore, several studies conducted on the topic of exercise training have recognized the central role of both endurance and resistance exercise to reorganize sarcomeric proteins and to improve the capacity of cells to build efﬁcient organelles. The molecular mechanisms underlying these adaptations to exercise training are presented throughout this review and practical recommendations for exercise prescription are provided. A better understanding of the aforementioned cellular pathways is essential for both healthy and sick people to avoid inefﬁcient prescriptions and to improve muscle function with emergent strategies (e.g., hypoxic training). Finally, current limitations in the literature and further perspectives, notably on epigenetic mechanisms, are provided to encourage additional investigations on this topic.},

Adult ({\textgreater}4 mo) HSA-GFP mice performed PoWeR for 8 wk then detrained for 12 wk; age-matched untrained mice were used to control for the long duration of the study. Myonuclei and interstitial nuclei from plantaris muscles were isolated for RRBS. Relative to untrained, PoWeR caused similar myonuclear CpG hypo- and hyper-methylation of promoter regions and substantial hypomethylation in interstitial nuclear promoters. Over-representation analysis of promoters revealed a larger number of hyper- versus hypo-methylated pathways in both nuclear populations after training and evidence for reciprocal regulation of methylation between nucleus types, with hypomethylation of promoter regions in Wnt signaling-related genes in myonuclei and hypermethylation in interstitial nuclei. After 12 wk of detraining, promoter CpGs in documented muscle remodeling-associated genes and pathways that were differentially methylated immediately after PoWeR were persistently differentially methylated in myonuclei, along with long-term promoter hypomethylation in interstitial nuclei. No enduring gene expression changes in muscle tissue were observed using RNA-sequencing. Upon 4 wk of retraining, mice that trained previously grew more at the whole muscle and fiber type-specific cellular level than training na¨ıve mice, with no difference in myonuclear number. Muscle nuclei have a methylation epi-memory of prior training that may augment muscle adaptability to retraining.},

Early satellite cell EV communication primes the muscle milieu for proper long-term extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and is sufﬁcient to support sustained hypertrophy in adult mice, even in the absence of fusion to muscle ﬁbers. Satellite cells modulate chemokine gene expression across cell types within the ﬁrst few days of loading, and EV delivery of miR206 to ﬁbrogenic cells represses Wisp1 expression required for appropriate ECM remodeling. Late-stage communication from myogenic cells during loading is widespread but may be targeted toward endothelial cells.

Our group has aimed to address whether satellite cells are required for hypertrophic growth in mature skeletal muscle. Here, we generated a comprehensive characterization and transcriptome-wide proﬁling of skeletal muscle during adaptation to exercise in the presence or absence of satellite cells in order to identify distinct phenotypes and gene networks inﬂuenced by satellite cell content. We administered vehicle or tamoxifen to adult Pax7-DTA mice and subjected them to progressive weighted wheel running (PoWeR). We then performed immunohistochemical analysis and whole-muscle RNA-seq of vehicle (SCþ) and tamoxifen-treated (SCÀ) mice. Further, we performed single myonuclear RNA-seq to provide detailed information on how satellite cell fusion affects myonuclear transcription. We show that while skeletal muscle can mount a robust hypertrophic response to PoWeR in the absence of satellite cells, growth, and adaptation are ultimately blunted. Transcriptional proﬁling reveals several gene networks key to muscle adaptation are altered in the absence of satellite cells.},

	abstract = {Aging is associated with a decline in skeletal muscle mass and function—termed sarcopenia—as mediated, in part, by muscle anabolic resistance. This metabolic phenomenon describes the impaired response of muscle protein synthesis (MPS) to the provision of dietary amino acids and practice of resistance-based exercise. Recent observations highlight the gut-muscle axis as a physiological target for combatting anabolic resistance and reducing risk of sarcopenia. Experimental studies, primarily conducted in animal models of aging, suggest a mechanistic link between the gut microbiota and muscle atrophy, mediated via the modulation of systemic amino acid availability and low-grade inﬂammation that are both physiological factors known to underpin anabolic resistance. Moreover, in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrate the action of speciﬁc gut bacteria (Lactobacillus and Biﬁdobacterium) to increase systemic amino acid availability and elicit an anti-inﬂammatory response in the intestinal lumen. Prospective lifestyle approaches that target the gut-muscle axis have recently been examined in the context of mitigating sarcopenia risk. These approaches include increasing dietary ﬁber intake that promotes the growth and development of gut bacteria, thus enhancing the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) (acetate, propionate, and butyrate). Prebiotic/probiotic/symbiotic supplementation also generates SCFA and may mitigate low-grade inﬂammation in older adults via modulation of the gut microbiota. Preliminary evidence also highlights the role of exercise in increasing the production of SCFA. Accordingly, lifestyle approaches that combine diets rich in ﬁber and probiotic supplementation with exercise training may serve to produce SCFA and increase microbial diversity, and thus may target the gut-muscle axis in mitigating anabolic resistance in older adults. Future mechanistic studies are warranted to establish the direct physiological action of distinct gut microbiota phenotypes on amino acid utilization and the postprandial stimulation of muscle protein synthesis in older adults.},

	abstract = {Objective The commensal microbiota, host immunity and metabolism participate in a signalling network, with diet inﬂuencing each component of this triad. In addition to diet, many elements of a modern lifestyle inﬂuence the gut microbiota but the degree to which exercise affects this population is unclear. Therefore, we explored exercise and diet for their impact on the gut microbiota. Design Since extremes of exercise often accompany extremes of diet, we addressed the issue by studying professional athletes from an international rugby union squad. Two groups were included to control for physical size, age and gender. Compositional analysis of the microbiota was explored by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Each participant completed a detailed food frequency questionnaire.
Results As expected, athletes and controls differed signiﬁcantly with respect to plasma creatine kinase (a marker of extreme exercise), and inﬂammatory and metabolic markers. More importantly, athletes had a higher diversity of gut micro-organisms, representing 22 distinct phyla, which in turn positively correlated with protein consumption and creatine kinase.
Conclusions The results provide evidence for a beneﬁcial impact of exercise on gut microbiota diversity but also indicate that the relationship is complex and is related to accompanying dietary extremes.},

Physiol Rev 84: 649–698, 2004; 10.1152/physrev.00031.2003.—The extracellular matrix (ECM), and especially the connective tissue with its collagen, links tissues of the body together and plays an important role in the force transmission and tissue structure maintenance especially in tendons, ligaments, bone, and muscle. The ECM turnover is influenced by physical activity, and both collagen synthesis and degrading metalloprotease enzymes increase with mechanical loading. Both transcription and posttranslational modifications, as well as local and systemic release of growth factors, are enhanced following exercise. For tendons, metabolic activity, circulatory responses, and collagen turnover are demonstrated to be more pronounced in humans than hitherto thought. Conversely, inactivity markedly decreases collagen turnover in both tendon and muscle. Chronic loading in the form of physical training leads both to increased collagen turnover as well as, dependent on the type of collagen in question, some degree of net collagen synthesis. These changes will modify the mechanical properties and the viscoelastic characteristics of the tissue, decrease its stress, and likely make it more load resistant. Cross-linking in connective tissue involves an intimate, enzymatical interplay between collagen synthesis and ECM proteoglycan components during growth and maturation and influences the collagen-derived functional properties of the tissue. With aging, glycation contributes to additional cross-linking which modifies tissue stiffness. Physiological signaling pathways from mechanical loading to changes in ECM most likely involve feedback signaling that results in rapid alterations in the mechanical properties of the ECM. In developing skeletal muscle, an important interplay between muscle cells and the ECM is present, and some evidence from adult human muscle suggests common signaling pathways to stimulate contractile and ECM components. Unaccostumed overloading responses suggest an important role of ECM in the adaptation of myofibrillar structures in adult muscle. Development of overuse injury in tendons involve morphological and biochemical changes including altered collagen typing and fibril size, hypervascularization zones, accumulation of nociceptive substances, and impaired collagen degradation activity. Counteracting these phenomena requires adjusted loading rather than absence of loading in the form of immobilization. Full understanding of these physiological processes will provide the physiological basis for understanding of tissue overloading and injury seen in both tendons and muscle with repetitive work and leisure time physical activity.},

	abstract = {While force-velocity-power characteristics of resistance exercises, such as bench presses and squats, have been well documented, little attention has been paid to load, force, and power-velocity relationships in exercises engaging core muscles. Given that power produced during lifting tasks or trunk rotations plays an important role in most sport-speciﬁc and daily life activities, its measurement should represent an important part of the test battery in both athletes and the general population. The aim of this scoping review was 1) to map the literature related to testing methods assessing core muscle strength and stability in sport and rehabilitation, chieﬂy studies with particular focus on force-velocity-power characteristics of exercises involving the use of core muscles, 2) and to identify gaps in existing studies and suggest further research in this ﬁeld. The literature search was conducted on Cochrane Library databases, Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed and MEDLINE, which was completed by SpringerLink, Google Scholar and Elsevier. The inclusion criteria were met in 37 articles. Results revealed that among a variety of studies investigating the core stability and core strength in sport and rehabilitation, only few of them analyzed force–velocity–power characteristics of exercises involving the use of core muscles. Most of them evaluated maximal isometric strength of the core and its endurance. However, there are some studies that assessed muscle power during lifting tasks at different loads performed either with free weights or using the Smith machine. Similarly, power and velocity were assessed during trunk rotations performed with different weights when standing or sitting. Nevertheless, there is still scant research investigating the power-velocity and force-velocity relationship during exercises engaging core muscles in able-bodied and para athletes with different demands on stability and strength of the core. Therefore, more research is needed to address this gap in the literature and aim research at assessing strength and power-related measures within cross-sectional and intervention studies. A better understanding of the power-force-velocity proﬁles during exercises with high demands on the core musculature has implications for designing sport training and rehabilitation programs for enhancement of athletes’ performance and/or decrease their risk of back pain.},

	abstract = {The adaptive plasticity of mitochondria within a skeletal muscle is regulated by signals converging on a myriad of regulatory networks that operate during conditions of increased (i.e., exercise) and decreased (inactivity, disuse) energy requirements. Notably, some of the initial signals that induce adaptive responses are common to both conditions, differing in their magnitude and temporal pattern, to produce vastly opposing mitochondrial phenotypes. In response to exercise, signaling to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-c coactivator-1a (PGC-1a) and other regulators ultimately produces an abundance of high-quality mitochondria, leading to reduced mitophagy and a higher mitochondrial content. This is accompanied by the presence of an enhanced protein quality control system that consists of the protein import machinery as well chaperones and proteases termed the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt). The UPRmt monitors intraorganelle proteostasis, and strives to maintain a mito-nuclear balance between nuclear- and mtDNA-derived gene products via retrograde signaling from the organelle to the nucleus. In addition, antioxidant capacity is improved, affording greater protection against oxidative stress. In contrast, chronic disuse conditions produce similar signaling but result in decrements in mitochondrial quality and content. Thus, the interactive cross talk of the regulatory networks that control organelle turnover during wide variations in muscle use and disuse remain incompletely understood, despite our improving knowledge of the traditional regulators of organelle content and function. This brief review acknowledges existing regulatory networks and summarizes recent discoveries of novel biological pathways involved in determining organelle biogenesis, dynamics, mitophagy, protein quality control, and antioxidant capacity, identifying ample protein targets for therapeutic intervention that determine muscle and mitochondrial health.},

This study aimed to evaluate the supplemental effect of Cr on protein metabolism under normal and starvation conditions. The primary myoblasts were obtained from the breast muscle of chicks. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/P70S6 kinase (P70S6K), ubiquitin-proteasome (UP) pathways, and mitochondrial function of myotubes were evaluated at normal or starvation state and with or without glucose supplementation. Under normal condition, Cr supplementation enhanced protein synthesis rate as well as upregulated the total and phosphorylated P70S6K expressions. Cr had little inﬂuence on protein catabolism and mitochondrial function. In a starvation state, however, Cr alleviated myotube atrophy and enhanced protein accretion by inhibiting Atrogin1 and myostatin (MSTN) expression. Furthermore, Cr treatment upregulated the transcriptional coactivators peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-c coactivator-1a (PGC-1a) expression and decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation under starvation condition. In the presence of glucose, however, the favorable effect of Cr on protein content and myotube diameter did not occur under starvation condition. The present result indicates that at a normal state, Cr stimulated protein synthesis via the mTOR/P70S6K pathway. In a starvation state, Cr mainly takes a favorable effect on protein accumulation via suppression of the UP pathway and mediated mitochondrial function mainly by serving as an energy supplier. The result highlights the potential clinical application for the modulation of muscle mass under different nutritional conditions.},

	abstract = {Skeletal muscle contractile function declines with aging, disease, and disuse. In vivo muscle contractile function depends on a variety of factors, but force, contractile velocity and power generating capacity ultimately derive from the summed contribution of single muscle ﬁbers. The contractile performance of these ﬁbers are, in turn, dependent upon the isoform and function of myoﬁlament proteins they express, with myosin protein expression and its mechanical and kinetic characteristics playing a predominant role. Alterations in myoﬁlament protein biology, therefore, may contribute to the development of functional limitations and disability in these conditions. Recent studies suggest that these conditions are associated with altered single ﬁber performance due to decreased expression of myoﬁlament proteins and/or changes in myosin-actin cross-bridge interactions. Furthermore, cellular and myoﬁlament-level adaptations are related to diminished whole muscle and whole body performance. Notably, the effect of these various conditions on myoﬁlament and single ﬁber function tends to be larger in older women compared to older men, which may partially contribute to their higher rates of disability. To maintain functionality and provide the most appropriate and effective countermeasures to aging, disease, and disuse in both sexes, a more thorough understanding is needed of the contribution of myoﬁlament adaptations to functional disability in older men and women and their contribution to tissue level function and mobility impairment.},

To this end, several methodologies are presented, including geometrically-based, physically-based, and data-driven approaches. On the other hand, the simulation of physiological muscle functions aims to identify the biomechanical controls responsible for realistic human motion. Estimating these muscle controls has been pursued through static and dynamic simulations. We review and discuss all these approaches, and conclude with suggestions for future research.},

	abstract = {Muscle-driven simulations of human and animal motion are widely used to complement physical experiments for studying movement dynamics. Musculotendon models are an essential component of muscle-driven simulations, yet neither the computational speed nor the biological accuracy of the simulated forces has been adequately evaluated. Here we compare the speed and accuracy of three musculotendon models: two with an elastic tendon (an equilibrium model and a damped equilibrium model) and one with a rigid tendon. Our simulation benchmarks demonstrate that the equilibrium and damped equilibrium models produce similar force profiles but have different computational speeds. At low activation, the damped equilibrium model is 29 times faster than the equilibrium model when using an explicit integrator and 3 times faster when using an implicit integrator; at high activation, the two models have similar simulation speeds. In the special case of simulating a muscle with a short tendon, the rigid-tendon model produces forces that match those generated by the elastic-tendon models, but simulates 2–54 times faster when an explicit integrator is used and 6–31 times faster when an implicit integrator is used. The equilibrium, damped equilibrium, and rigid-tendon models reproduce forces generated by maximally-activated biological muscle with mean absolute errors less than 8.9\%, 8.9\%, and 20.9\% of the maximum isometric muscle force, respectively. When compared to forces generated by submaximally-activated biological muscle, the forces produced by the equilibrium, damped equilibrium, and rigid-tendon models have mean absolute errors less than 16.2\%, 16.4\%, and 18.5\%, respectively. To encourage further development of musculotendon models, we provide implementations of each of these models in OpenSim version 3.1 and benchmark data online, enabling others to reproduce our results and test their models of musculotendon dynamics.},

Sports Exerc., Vol. 46, No. 4, pp. 776–786, 2014. Introduction: Proximal biceps femoris musculotendon strain injury has been well established as a common injury among athletes participating in sports that require sprinting near or at maximum speed; however, little is known about the mechanisms that make this muscle tissue more susceptible to injury at faster speeds. Purpose: This study aimed to quantify localized tissue strain during sprinting at a range of speeds. Methods: Biceps femoris long head (BFlh) musculotendon dimensions of 14 athletes were measured on magnetic resonance (MR) images and used to generate a finite-element computational model. The model was first validated through comparison with previous dynamic MR experiments. After validation, muscle activation and muscle–tendon unit length change were derived from forward dynamic simulations of sprinting at 70\%, 85\%, and 100\% maximum speed and used as input to the computational model simulations. Simulations ran from midswing to foot contact. Results: The model predictions of local muscle tissue strain magnitude compared favorably with in vivo tissue strain measurements determined from dynamic MR experiments of the BFlh. For simulations of sprinting, local fiber strain was nonuniform at all speeds, with the highest muscle tissue strain where injury is often observed (proximal myotendinous junction). At faster sprinting speeds, increases were observed in fiber strain nonuniformity and peak local fiber strain (0.56, 0.67, and 0.72 for sprinting at 70\%, 85\%, and 100\% maximum speed). A histogram of local fiber strains showed that more of the BFlh reached larger local fiber strains at faster speeds. Conclusions: At faster sprinting speeds, peak local fiber strain, fiber strain nonuniformity, and the amount of muscle undergoing larger strains are predicted to increase, likely contributing to the BFlh muscle’s higher injury susceptibility at faster speeds.},

In addition, the evidence that mTOR is a dual regulator of anabolism and catabolism in skeletal muscle mass will be discussed.

	abstract = {Powerlifters are the epitome of muscular adaptation and are able to generate extreme forces. The molecular mechanisms underpinning the signiﬁcant capacity for force generation and hypertrophy are not fully elucidated. MicroRNAs (miRs) are short non-coding RNA sequences that control gene expression via promotion of transcript breakdown and/or translational inhibition. Differences in basal miR expression may partially account for phenotypic differences in muscle mass and function between powerlifters and untrained age-matched controls. Muscle biopsies were obtained from m. vastus lateralis of 15 national level powerlifters (25.1 ± 5.8 years) and 13 untrained controls (24.1 ± 2.0 years). The powerlifters were stronger than the controls (isokinetic knee extension at 60◦/s: 307.8 ± 51.6 Nm vs. 211.9 ± 41.9 Nm, respectively P {\textless} 0.001), and also had larger muscle ﬁbers (type I CSA 9,122 ± 1,238 vs. 4,511 ± 798 µm2 p {\textless} 0.001 and type II CSA 11,100 ± 1,656 vs. 5,468 ± 1,477 µm2 p {\textless} 0.001). Of the 17 miRs species analyzed, 12 were differently expressed (p {\textless} 0.05) between groups with 7 being more abundant in powerlifters and ﬁve having lower expression. Established transcriptionally regulated miR downstream gene targets involved in muscle mass regulation, including myostatin and MyoD, were also differentially expressed between groups. Correlation analysis demonstrates the abundance of eight miRs was correlated to phenotype including peak strength, ﬁber size, satellite cell abundance, and ﬁber type regardless of grouping. The unique miR expression proﬁles between groups allow for categorization of individuals as either powerlifter or healthy controls based on a ﬁve miR signature (miR-126, -23b, -16, -23a, -15a) with considerable accuracy (100\%). Thus, this unique miR expression may be important to the characterization of the powerlifter phenotype.},

	abstract = {An inﬂuential book written by A. Mosso in the late nineteenth century proposed that fatigue that “at ﬁrst sight might appear an imperfection of our body, is on the contrary one of its most marvelous perfections. The fatigue increasing more rapidly than the amount of work done saves us from the injury which lesser sensibility would involve for the organism” so that “muscular fatigue also is at bottom an exhaustion of the nervous system.” It has taken more than a century to conﬁrm Mosso’s idea that both the brain and the muscles alter their function during exercise and that fatigue is predominantly an emotion, part of a complex regulation, the goal of which is to protect the body from harm. Mosso’s ideas were supplanted in the English literature by those of A. V. Hill who believed that fatigue was the result of biochemical changes in the exercising limb muscles – “peripheral fatigue” – to which the central nervous system makes no contribution. The past decade has witnessed the growing realization that this brainless model cannot explain exercise performance. This article traces the evolution of our modern understanding of how the CNS regulates exercise speciﬁcally to insure that each exercise bout terminates whilst homeostasis is retained in all bodily systems. The brain uses the symptoms of fatigue as key regulators to insure that the exercise is completed before harm develops. These sensations of fatigue are unique to each individual and are illusionary since their generation is largely independent of the real biological state of the athlete at the time they develop. The model predicts that attempts to understand fatigue and to explain superior human athletic performance purely on the basis of the body’s known physiological and metabolic responses to exercise must fail since subconscious and conscious mental decisions made by winners and losers, in both training and competition, are the ultimate determinants of both fatigue and athletic performance.},

An estimate of the number of surviving motor units (MUs) represents a direct measure of the disease state in ALS. The objective of the study is to compare MU number estimation (MUNE) using the multipoint stimulation method (MPS) and compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) amplitude in patients with ALS.
Methods: Twenty-eight patients with ALS with a disease duration of 3–48 months were studied. Nerve conduction study of the median, ulnar, tibial, common peroneal, and sural nerves were done. Besides, electromyography (EMG) of cranio-bulbar, cervical, thoracic and lumbosacral muscles, and MPS-MUNE.
Results: MUNE is decreased in patients with ALS. MUNE was positively correlated with CMAP amplitude, medical research council (MRC) scale, and ALS functional rating scale (ALS-FRS). On the contrary, MUNE was negatively correlated with MUAP duration. Case detection by the MUNE methods was high as compared to that of CMAP amplitude.
Conclusions: MUNE is highly specific and more sensitive than CMAP amplitude in detecting the neurophysiologic abnormalities in patients with ALS. Case detection by MUNE is three times more than CMAP amplitudes. The rate of decline of motor units using the MPS-MUNE is more sensitive than the MRC score and ALSFRS-R when expressed as the percentage change from baseline.},

With advancing understanding of the complexity of human physiology, continually evolving methodological possibilities, and an increasingly dire public health situation, the study of exercise as a preventative or therapeutic treatment has never been more interdisciplinary, or more impactful. During the early stages of the NIH Common Fund Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) Initiative, the ﬁeld is well-positioned to build substantially upon the existing understanding of the mechanisms underlying beneﬁts associated with exercise. Thus, we present a comprehensive body of the knowledge detailing the current literature basis surrounding the molecular adaptations to exercise in humans to provide a view of the state of the ﬁeld at this critical juncture, as well as a resource for scientists bringing external expertise to the ﬁeld of exercise physiology. In reviewing current literature related to molecular and cellular processes underlying exercise-induced beneﬁts and adaptations, we also draw attention to existing knowledge gaps warranting continued research effort. © 2022 American Physiological Society.

	abstract = {Objective: Motor unit number index (MUNIX) is proposed to monitor neuromuscular disorders. Our objective is to determine the intra-individual variability over time of the MUNIX.
Methods: In 11 different hospital centres, MUNIX was assessed twice, at least 3 months apart (range 90-360 days), in tibialis anterior (TA), abductor pollicis brevis (APB), abductor digiti minimi (ADM) and deltoid muscles in 118 healthy subjects. MUNIX sum score 2, 3 and 4 were respectively the sum of the MUNIX of the TA and ADM, of the TA, APB and ADM and of the TA, APB, ADM and deltoid muscles.
Results: The repeatability of the MUNIX was better for sum scores than for single muscle recordings. The variability of the MUNIX was independent of sex, age, interval between measurements and was lower for experienced than non-experienced operators. The 95th percentile of the coefficient of variability of the MUNIX sum score 2, 3 and 4 were respectively 22\%, 18\% and 15\% for experienced operators.
Conclusions: The MUNIX technique must be performed by experienced operators on several muscles to reduce its variability and improve its reliability. Significance: A variation of the MUNIX sum score ≥ 20\% can be interpreted as a significant change of muscle innervation.},

Purpose: The aim of the study was to observe the breathing pattern in individuals with low back pain (LBP) both at rest and during motor control tasks. Material and Method: 150 patients with LBP participated in this study and they were subcategorized further in acute, sub-acute and chronic low back pain patients. The breathing pattern was evaluated at rest (standing and supine position during both relaxed breathing and deep breathing) and while performing clinical motor control tasks, i.e. bent knee fall out, knee lift abdominal test and active straight leg raise. Breathing patterns in patients with LBP were assessed by therapist both visually and via palpation and observational findings were noted. Costo-diaphragmatic breathing was considered as normal breathing pattern.
Result: Observational findings of this study demonstrates altered breathing pattern in patients with LBP during motor control tasks.
Conclusion: At rest, no significant differences were observed in breathing patterns of LBP patients, whereas around 71\% patients revealed abnormal breathing pattern during motor control tests.},

                  Excessive exercise-induced shortness of breath is a common complaint. For some, exercise-induced bronchoconstriction is the primary cause and for a small minority there may be an alternative organic pathology. However for many, the cause will be simply reaching their physiological limit or be due to a functional form of dysfunctional breathing, neither of which require drug therapy.
                
                
                  The physiological limit category includes deconditioned individuals, such as those who have been through intensive care and require rehabilitation, as well as the unfit and the fit competitive athlete who has reached their limit with both of these latter groups requiring explanation and advice.
                
                
                  Dysfunctional breathing is an umbrella term for an alteration in the normal biomechanical patterns of breathing that result in intermittent or chronic symptoms, which may be respiratory and/or nonrespiratory. This alteration may be due to structural causes or, much more commonly, be functional as exemplified by thoracic pattern disordered breathing (PDB) and extrathoracic paradoxical vocal fold motion disorder (pVFMD).
                
                
                  Careful history and examination together with spirometry may identify those likely to have PDB and/or pVFMD. Where there is doubt about aetiology, cardiopulmonary exercise testing may be required to identify the deconditioned, unfit or fit individual reaching their physiological limit and PDB, while continuous laryngoscopy during exercise is increasingly becoming the benchmark for assessing extrathoracic causes.
                
                
                  Accurate assessment and diagnosis can prevent excessive use of drug therapy and result in effective management of the cause of the individual’s complaint through cost-effective approaches such as reassurance, advice, breathing retraining and vocal exercises.
                
              
            
            
              
              This review provides an overview of the spectrum of conditions that can present as exercise-­induced breathlessness experienced by young subjects participating in sport and aims to promote understanding of the need for accurate assessment of an individual’s symptoms. We will highlight the high incidence of nonasthmatic causes, which simply require reassurance or simple interventions from respiratory physiotherapists or speech pathologists.},

	abstract = {Breathing is unquestionably a key function of the human body; it sustains life by providing oxygen needed for metabolism and removing the by-product of these reactions, carbon dioxide. Breathing, however, has other functions apart from the ventilation of air and the maintenance of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Breathing affects motor control and postural stability and plays several roles in physiological and psychological regulation. Breathing can influence homeostatic functions in other system including the autonomic nervous system, the circulatory system, chemical regulation and metabolism. Breathing becomes dysfunctional when the person is unable to breathe efficiently or when breathing is inappropriate, unhelpful or inefficient in responding to environmental conditions and the changing needs of the individual. Impairment of the functions of breathing affects people's lives, challenging homeostasis, creating symptoms and compromising health. The efficiency with which breathing fulfills its various functions can be diminished because of musculo-skeletal dysfunction, disease, chronic psychological stress or other factors that affect respiratory drive and respiratory control. The neurological control of breathing shows high levels of neuroplasticity as shown by its ability to adapt to a wide range of internal and external conditions. Breathing therapy generally aims to either correct dysfunctions of breathing or enhance its functions. Breathing, unlike most physiological functions, can be controlled voluntarily and it can serve as an entry point for physiological and psychological regulation. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Deﬁnition of both voluntary and evoked MU recruitment schemes are described, enabling the study of both contractions in isometric conditions. During this type of contraction, there is no movement of the joints and the tendon-muscle complex remains at the same length. Moreover, some well-established macroscopic relationships such as force-length or force-velocity properties are considered. A comparison with a twitch model using the same input deﬁnition is provided with both recruitment schemes exhibiting limitations of twitch type models. Finally, the proposed model is validated with a comparison between simulated and recorded force proﬁles following eight electrical stimulation in isometric conditions. The simulated muscle force was generated to mimic the one recorded from the quadriceps of a patient implanted with a functional electrical stimulation neuroprosthesis.

            Electromyostimulation (EMS) incorporates the use of electrical current to activate skeletal muscle and facilitate contraction. It is commonly used in clinical settings to mimic voluntary contractions and enhance the rehabilitation of human skeletal muscles. Although the beneficial effects of EMS are widely accepted, discrepancies concerning the specific responses to EMS versus voluntary actions exist. The unique effects of EMS have been attributed to several mechanisms, most notably a reversal of the recruitment pattern typically associated with voluntary muscle activation. This perspective outlines the authors' contention that electrical stimulation recruits motor units in a nonselective, spatially fixed, and temporally synchronous pattern. Furthermore, it synthesizes the evidence that supports the contention that this recruitment pattern contributes to increased muscle fatigue when compared with voluntary actions. The authors believe the majority of evidence suggests that EMS-induced motor unit recruitment is nonselective and that muscle fibers are recruited without obvious sequencing related to fiber types.},

Muscle activity was measured from the soleus (SOL), medial gastrocnemius (MG) and lateral gastrocnemius (LG) using surface electromyography (EMG) and quantified using wavelet and principal component analysis. Muscle fascicle strain rates were quantified using ultrasonography, and the muscle–tendon unit lengths were calculated from the segmental kinematics. The EMG intensities showed that the body uses the SOL relatively more for the higher-force, lower-velocity contractions than the MG and LG. The EMG spectra showed a shift to higher frequencies at faster muscle fascicle strain rates for MG: these shifts were independent of the level of muscle activity, the locomotor load and the muscle fascicle strain. These results indicated that a selective recruitment of the faster motor units occurred within the MG muscle in response to the increasing muscle fascicle strain rates. This preferential recruitment of the faster fibres for the faster tasks indicates that in some circumstances motor unit recruitment during locomotion can match the contractile properties of the muscle fibres to the mechanical demands of the contraction.},

	abstract = {SUMMARY
            Muscle fibres have a range of contractile properties from fast to slow. Traditional understanding of muscle fibre recruitment suggests that the slower fibres within a mixed muscle are used for all contractions including those at rapid speeds. However, mechanical arguments predict that some locomotor tasks are best performed by solely the faster fibres. Motor recruitment patterns can be indicated by the spectral properties of the myoelectric signals. High- and low-frequency myoelectric spectra that have similar spectral power indicate the activity of faster and slower motor units, respectively. In this study,the myoelectric signals in humans were measured from nine muscles of the leg during walking and running at 1.5, 3 and 4.5 m s–1. The myoelectric spectra for 20 points in each stride were calculated using wavelet techniques, and the spectral properties quantified using principal component analysis. Bursts of muscle activity were characterized by hysteresis in the myoelectric frequencies, with different frequencies occurring at different times, indicating time-varying shifts in the motor recruitment patterns. This hysteresis occurred at all locomotor speeds tested. It is likely that the different types of motor unit are recruited in a task-dependent fashion during locomotion.},

This study tested whether a muscle model comprised of motor units that could be independently activated resulted in more accurate predictions of force than traditional Hill-type models. Forces predicted by the models were evaluated by direct comparison with the muscle forces measured in situ from the gastrocnemii in goats. The muscle was stimulated tetanically at a range of frequencies, muscle fiber strains were measured using sonomicrometry, and the activation patterns of the different types of motor unit were calculated from electromyographic recordings. Activation patterns were input into five different muscle models. Four models were traditional Hill-type models with different intrinsic speeds and fibertype properties. The fifth model incorporated differential groups of fast and slow motor units.

However, these models have limited accuracy, particularly during cyclic contractions at the submaximal levels of activation that typically occur during locomotion. To address this issue, recent studies have incorporated effects into Hill-type models that are oftentimes neglected, such as size-dependent, history-dependent, and activation-dependent effects. However, the contribution of these effects on muscle performance has yet to be evaluated under common contractile conditions that reflect the range of activations, strains, and strain rates that occur in vivo. The purpose of this study was to develop a modelling framework to evaluate modifications to Hill-type muscle models when they contract in cyclic loops that are typical of locomotor muscle function. Here we present a modelling framework composed of a damped harmonic oscillator in series with a Hill-type muscle actuator that consists of a contractile element and parallel elastic element. The intrinsic force-length and force-velocity properties are described using Be´zier curves where we present a system to relate physiological parameters to the control points for these curves. The muscle-oscillator system can be geometrically scaled while preserving dynamic and kinematic similarity to investigate the muscle size effects while controlling for the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator. The model is driven by time-varying muscle activations that cause the muscle to cyclically contract and drive the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator. Thus, this framework provides a platform to test current and future Hill-type model formulations and explore factors affecting muscle performance in muscles of different sizes under a range of cyclic contractile conditions.},

	abstract = {During muscle contractions, the muscle fascicles may shorten at a rate different from the muscle-tendon unit, and the ratio of these velocities is its gearing. Appropriate gearing allows fascicles to reduce their shortening velocities and allows them to operate at effective shortening velocities across a range of movements. Gearing of the muscle fascicles within the muscle belly is the result of rotations of the fascicles and bulging of the belly. Variable gearing can also occur as a result of tendon length changes that can be caused by changes in the relative timing of muscle activity for different mechanical tasks. Recruitment patterns of slow and fast fibres are crucial for achieving optimal muscle performance, and coordination between muscles is related to whole limb performance. Poor coordination leads to inefficiencies and loss of power, and optimal coordination is required for high power outputs and high mechanical efficiencies from the limb. This paper summarizes key studies in these areas of neuromuscular mechanics and results from studies where we have tested these phenomena on a cycle ergometer are presented to highlight novel insights. The studies show how muscle structure and neural activation interact to generate smooth and effective motion of the body.},

This thinking explained most observations for concentric and isometric, but not for eccentric muscle contractions. Just over a decade ago, we discovered that eccentric contractions were associated with a force that could not be assigned to actin and myosin, but was at least in part associated with the ﬁlamentous protein titin. Titin was found to bind calcium upon activation, thereby increasing its structural stability, and thus its stiffness and force. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that the proximal part of titin binds to actin in an activation- and force-dependent manner, thereby shortening its free length, thus increasing its stiffness and force. Therefore, we propose that muscle contraction involves three ﬁlaments, actin, myosin and titin, and that titin regulates force by binding calcium and by shortening its spring length by binding to actin.},

However, determining properties of individual muscles in vivo remains a challenge because muscles usually function within a synergistic group. Modeling has been used to estimate the properties of an individual muscle from the experimental measurement of the muscle group properties. While this approach can be valuable, the models and the associated predictions are difficult to validate. In this study, we measured the in situ F–V properties of the maximally activated kangaroo rat plantarflexor group and used two different assumptions and associated models to estimate the properties of the individual plantarflexors. The first model (Mdl1) assumed that the percent contributions of individual muscles to group force and power were based upon the muscles’ cross-sectional area and were constant across the different isotonic loads applied to the muscle group. The second model (Mdl2) assumed that the F–V properties of the fibers within each muscle were identical, but because of differences in muscle architecture, the muscles’ contributions to the group properties changed with isotonic load. We compared the two model predictions with independent estimates of the muscles’ contributions based upon sonomicrometry measurements of muscle length. We found that predictions from Mdl2 were not significantly different from sonomicrometry-based estimates while those from Mdl1 were significantly different. The results of this study show that incorporating appropriate fiber properties and muscle architecture is necessary to parse the individual muscles’ contributions to the group F–V properties.},

	abstract = {Mammalian skeletal muscles are comprised of many motor units, each containing a group of muscle fibres that have common contractile properties: these can be broadly categorized as slow and fast twitch muscle fibres. Motor units are typically recruited in an orderly fashion following the ‘size principle’, in which slower motor units would be recruited for low intensity contraction; a metabolically cheap and fatigue-resistant strategy. However, this recruitment strategy poses a mechanical paradox for fast, low intensity contractions, in which the recruitment of slower fibres, as predicted by the size principle, would be metabolically more costly than the recruitment of faster fibres that are more efficient at higher contraction speeds. Hence, it would be mechanically and metabolically more effective for recruitment strategies to vary in response to contraction speed so that the intrinsic efficiencies and contraction speeds of the recruited muscle fibres are matched to the mechanical demands of the task. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of a novel, mixed cost function within a musculoskeletal simulation, which includes the metabolic cost of contraction, to predict the recruitment of different muscle fibre types across a range of loads and speeds. Our results show that a metabolically informed cost function predicts favoured recruitment of slower muscle fibres for slower and isometric tasks versus recruitment that favours faster muscles fibres for higher velocity contractions. This cost function predicts a change in recruitment patterns consistent with experimental observations, and also predicts a less expensive metabolic cost for these muscle contractions regardless of speed of the movement. Hence, our findings support the premise that varying motor recruitment strategies to match the mechanical demands of a movement task results in a mechanically and metabolically sensible way to deploy the different types of motor unit.},

            The purpose of this perspective is to present a general theory—the Physical Stress Theory (PST). The basic premise of the PST is that changes in the relative level of physical stress cause a predictable adaptive response in all biological tissue. Specific thresholds define the upper and lower stress levels for each characteristic tissue response. Qualitatively, the 5 tissue responses to physical stress are decreased stress tolerance (eg, atrophy), maintenance, increased stress tolerance (eg, hypertrophy), injury, and death. Fundamental principles of tissue adaptation to physical stress are described that, in the authors' opinion, can be used to help guide physical therapy practice, education, and research. The description of fundamental principles is followed by a review of selected literature describing adaptation to physical stress for each of the 4 main organ systems described in the Guide to Physical Therapist Practice (ie, cardiovascular/pulmonary, integumentary, musculoskeletal, neuromuscular). Limitations and implications of the PST for practice, research, and education are presented.},

Fifteen young, healthy males completed explosive voluntary knee extensions in five conditions: isometric (ISO), and both concentric and eccentric at two constant accelerations of 500 deg s−2 (CONSLOW and ECCSLOW) and 2000 deg s−2 (CONFAST and ECCFAST). Explosive torque and quadriceps EMG were recorded every 25 ms up to 150 ms from their respective onsets and normalised to the available MVT and EMG at MVT, respectively, specific to that joint angle and velocity. Neural efficacy (explosive voluntary:evoked octet torque) was also measured, and torque data were entered into a Hill-type muscle model to estimate muscle performance. Explosive torques normalised to MVT (and normalised muscle forces) were greatest in the concentric followed by the isometric and eccentric conditions, and in the fast compared with slow speeds within the same contraction type (CONFAST{\textgreater}CONSLOW{\textgreater}ISO, and ECCFAST{\textgreater}ECCSLOW). Normalised explosive-phase EMG and neural efficacy were greatest in concentric conditions, followed by isometric and eccentric conditions, but were similar for fast and slow contractions of the same type. Thus, distinct neuromuscular activation appeared to explain the effect of contraction type but not speed on normalised explosive torque, suggesting the speed effect is an intrinsic contractile property. These results provide novel evidence that the ability to rapidly increase torque/force and utilise the available MVT is influenced by both contraction type and speed, owing to neural and contractile mechanisms, respectively.},

Passive tension was modeled with a two-element Hill-type model. Experimental length-tension relations were then measured for each of these muscles and compared to predictions. The model was able to accurately capture the activetension characteristics of experimentally-measured data for all muscles (ICC¼ 0.88 70.03). Despite their varied architecture, no differences in predicted versus experimental correlations were observed among muscles. In addition, the model demonstrated that excursion, quantiﬁed by full-width-at-halfmaximum (FWHM) of the active length-tension relationship, scaled linearly (slope ¼0.68) with normalized muscle ﬁber length. Experimental and theoretical FWHM values agreed well with an intraclass correlation coefﬁcient of 0.99 (p o 0.001). In contrast to active tension, the passive tension model deviated from experimentally-measured values and thus, was not an accurate predictor of passive tension (ICC ¼0.70 7 0.07). These data demonstrate that modeling muscle as a scaled sarcomere provides accurate active functional but not passive functional predictions for rabbit TA, EDL, and EDII muscles and call into question the need for more complex modeling assumptions often proposed.},

	volume = {13},
	abstract = {Sarcomeres are the smallest functional contractile unit of muscle, and myoﬁbrils are striated muscle organelles that are comprised of sarcomeres that are strictly aligned in series. Furthermore, passive forces in sarcomeres and myoﬁbrils are almost exclusively produced by the structural protein titin, and all contractile, regulatory, and structural proteins are in their natural conﬁguration. For these mechanical and structural reasons single sarcomere and myoﬁbril preparations are arguably the most powerful to answer questions on the mechanisms of striated muscle contraction. We developed and optimized single myoﬁbril research over the past 20 years and were the ﬁrst to mechanically isolate and test single sarcomeres. The results from this research led to the uncovering of the crucial role of titin in muscle contraction, ﬁrst molecular explanations for the origins of the passive and the residual force enhancement properties of skeletal and cardiac muscles, the discovery of sarcomere length stability on the descending limb of the force-length relationship, and culminating in the formulation of the three-ﬁlament theory of muscle contraction that, aside from actin and myosin, proposes a crucial role of titin in active force production. Aside from all the advantages and possibilities that single sarcomere and myoﬁbril preparations offer, there are also disadvantages. These include the fragility of the preparation, the time-consuming training to master these preparations, the limited spatial resolution for length and force measurements, and the unavailability of commercial systems for single sarcomere/myoﬁbril research. Ignoring the mechanics that govern serially linked systems, not considering the spatial resolution and associated accuracies of myoﬁbril systems, and neglecting the fragility of myoﬁbril preparations, has led to erroneous interpretations of results and misleading conclusions. Here, we will attempt to describe the methods and possible applications of single sarcomere/myoﬁbril research and discuss the advantages and disadvantages by focusing on speciﬁc applications. It is hoped that this discussion may contribute to identifying the enormous potential of single sarcomere/myoﬁbril research in discovering the secrets of muscle contraction.},

              regulation of contraction in vertebrate striated muscle is exerted primarily through effects on the thin filament, which regulate strong cross-bridge binding to actin. Structural and biochemical studies suggest that the position of tropomyosin (Tm) and troponin (Tn) on the thin filament determines the interaction of myosin with the binding sites on actin. These binding sites can be characterized as blocked (unable to bind to cross bridges), closed (able to weakly bind cross bridges), or open (able to bind cross bridges so that they subsequently isomerize to become strongly bound and release ATP hydrolysis products). Flexibility of the Tm may allow variability in actin (A) affinity for myosin along the thin filament other than through a single 7 actin:1 tropomyosin:1 troponin (A
              7
              TmTn) regulatory unit. Tm position on the actin filament is regulated by the occupancy of NH-terminal Ca

              binding sites on TnC, conformational changes resulting from Ca
              2+
              binding, and changes in the interactions among Tn, Tm, and actin and as well as by strong S1 binding to actin. Ca
              2+
              binding to TnC enhances TnC-TnI interaction, weakens TnI attachment to its binding sites on 1–2 actins of the regulatory unit, increases Tm movement over the actin surface, and exposes myosin-binding sites on actin previously blocked by Tm. Adjacent Tm are coupled in their overlap regions where Tm movement is also controlled by interactions with TnT. TnT also interacts with TnC-TnI in a Ca
              2+
              -dependent manner. All these interactions may vary with the different protein isoforms. The movement of Tm over the actin surface increases the “open” probability of myosin binding sites on actins so that some are in the open configuration available for myosin binding and cross-bridge isomerization to strong binding, force-producing states. In skeletal muscle, strong binding of cycling cross bridges promotes additional Tm movement. This movement effectively stabilizes Tm in the open position and allows cooperative activation of additional actins in that and possibly neighboring A

	abstract = {Experiments in cadavers have demonstrated signiﬁcant mechanical interactions between constituents of myofascial chains. However, evidence for such force transmission effects is scarce under in vivo conditions. The purpose of this trial was to examine the impact of ankle motion on soft tissue displacement of the dorsal thigh. Eleven healthy active individuals (26.8 ± 4.3 years, six males), in prone position and with the knee extended, underwent passive calf stretches (ankle dorsal extension) imposed by an isokinetic dynamometer. High-resolution ultrasound was used to simultaneously capture the displacement of the semimembranosus muscle, which was quantiﬁed by means of cross-correlation analysis. Inactivity of the leg muscles was controlled using surface electromyography (EMG). One participant had to be excluded due to major EMG activity during the experiment. According to a one-sample t test testing the difference to the neutral zero position, ankle dorsal extension induced substantial caudal muscle displacements (5.76 ± 2.67 mm, p {\textless} 0.0001). Correlation analysis (Spearman), furthermore, revealed a strong association between maximal dorsal extension and semimembranosus motion (rho = 0.76, p = 0.02). In conclusion, the present trial provides initial in vivo evidence for a mechanical force transmission between serially connected skeletal muscles. This means that local alterations of the mechanical tissue properties may modify ﬂexibility in neighboring (superior or inferior) joints.},

	abstract = {The well-established sliding ﬁlament and cross-bridge theory explain the major biophysical mechanism responsible for a skeletal muscle’s active behavior on a cellular level. However, the biomechanical function of skeletal muscles on the tissue scale, which is caused by the complex interplay of muscle ﬁbers and extracellular connective tissue, is much less understood. Mathematical models provide one possibility to investigate physiological hypotheses. Continuum-mechanical models have hereby proven themselves to be very suitable to study the biomechanical behavior of whole muscles or entire limbs. Existing continuum-mechanical skeletal muscle models use either an active-stress or an active-strain approach to phenomenologically describe the mechanical behavior of active contractions. While any macroscopic constitutive model can be judged by it’s ability to accurately replicate experimental data, the evaluation of muscle-speciﬁc material descriptions is difﬁcult as suitable data is, unfortunately, currently not available. Thus, the discussions become more philosophical rather than following rigid methodological criteria. Within this work, we provide a extensive discussion on the underlying modeling assumptions of both the active-stress and the active-strain approach in the context of existing hypotheses of skeletal muscle physiology. We conclude that the active-stress approach resolves an idealized tissue transmitting active stresses through an independent pathway. In contrast, the active-strain approach reﬂects an idealized tissue employing an indirect, coupled pathway for active stress transmission. Finally the physiological hypothesis that skeletal muscles exhibit redundant pathways of intramuscular stress transmission represents the basis for considering a mixed-active-stress-active-strain constitutive framework.},

	abstract = {During muscle contraction, chemical energy is converted to mechanical energy when ATP is hydrolysed during cross-bridge cycling. This mechanical energy is then distributed and stored in the tissue as the muscle deforms or is used to perform external work. We previously showed how energy is distributed through contracting muscle during ﬁxed-end contractions; however, it is not clear how the distribution of tissue energy is altered by the kinetic energy of muscle mass during dynamic contractions. In this study we conducted simulations of a 3D continuum muscle model that accounts for tissue mass, as well as force-velocity effects, in which the muscle underwent sinusoidal work-loop contractions coupled with bursts of excitation. We found that increasing muscle size, and therefore mass, increased the kinetic energy per unit volume of the muscle. In addition to greater relative kinetic energy per cycle, relatively more energy was also stored in the aponeurosis, and less was stored in the base material, which represented the intra and extracellular tissue components apart from the myoﬁbrils. These energy changes in larger muscles due to greater mass were associated lower mass-speciﬁc mechanical work output per cycle, and this reduction in mass-speciﬁc work was greatest for smaller initial pennation angles. When we compared the effects of mass on the model tissue behaviour to that of in situ muscle with added mass during comparable work-loop trials, we found that greater mass led to lower maximum and higher minimum acceleration in the longitudinal (x) direction near the middle of the muscle compared to at the non-ﬁxed end, which indicates that greater mass contributes to tissue non-uniformity in whole muscle. These comparable results for the simulated and in situ muscle also show that this modelling framework behaves in ways that are consistent with experimental muscle. Overall, the results of this study highlight that muscle mass is an important determinant of whole muscle behaviour.},

	abstract = {In this study we examined how the strain energies within a muscle are related to changes in longitudinal force when the muscle is exposed to an external transverse load. We implemented a three-dimensional (3D) ﬁnite element model of contracting muscle using the principle of minimum total energy and allowing the redistribution of energy through different strain energy-densities. This allowed us to determine the importance of the strain energy-densities to the transverse forces developed by the muscle. We ran a series of in silica experiments on muscle blocks varying in initial pennation angle, muscle length, and external transverse load. As muscle contracts it maintains a near constant volume. As such, any changes in muscle length are balanced by deformations in the transverse directions such as muscle thickness or muscle width. Muscle develops transverse forces as it expands. In many situations external forces act to counteract these transverse forces and the muscle responds to external transverse loads while both passive and active. The muscle blocks used in our simulations decreased in thickness and pennation angle when passively compressed and pushed back on the load when they were activated. Activation of the compressed muscle blocks led either to an increase or decrease in muscle thickness depending on whether the initial pennation angle was less than or greater than 15◦, respectively. Furthermore, the strain energy increased and redistributed across the different strainenergy potentials during contraction. The volumetric strain energy-density varied with muscle length and pennation angle and was reduced with greater transverse load for most initial muscle lengths and pennation angles. External transverse load reduced the longitudinal muscle force for initial pennation angles of β0 = 0◦. Whereas for pennate muscle (β0 {\textgreater} 0◦) longitudinal force changed (increase or decrease) depending on the muscle length, pennation angle and the direction of the external load relative to the muscle ﬁbres. For muscle blocks with initial pennation angles β0 ≤ 20◦ the reduction in longitudinal muscle force coincided with a reduction in volumetric strain energy-density.},

	abstract = {During contraction the energy of muscle tissue increases due to energy from the hydrolysis of ATP. This energy is distributed across the tissue as strain-energy potentials in the contractile elements, strain-energy potential from the 3D deformation of the base-material tissue (containing cellular and extracellular matrix effects), energy related to changes in the muscle’s nearly incompressible volume and external work done at the muscle surface. Thus, energy is redistributed through the muscle’s tissue as it contracts, with only a component of this energy being used to do mechanical work and develop forces in the muscle’s longitudinal direction. Understanding how the strain-energy potentials are redistributed through the muscle tissue will help enlighten why the mechanical performance of whole muscle in its longitudinal direction does not match the performance that would be expected from the contractile elements alone. Here we demonstrate these physical effects using a 3D muscle model based on the ﬁnite element method. The tissue deformations within contracting muscle are large, and so the mechanics of contraction were explained using the principles of continuum mechanics for large deformations. We present simulations of a contracting medial gastrocnemius muscle, showing tissue deformations that mirror observations from magnetic resonance imaging. This paper tracks the redistribution of strain-energy potentials through the muscle tissue during ﬁxed-end contractions, and shows how ﬁbre shortening, pennation angle, transverse bulging and anisotropy in the stress and strain of the muscle tissue are all related to the interaction between the material properties of the muscle and the action of the contractile elements.},

	abstract = {Extracellular matrix (ECM) structures within skeletal muscle play an important, but underappreciated, role in muscle development, function and adaptation. Each individual muscle is surrounded by epimysial connective tissue and within the muscle there are two distinct extracellular matrix (ECM) structures, the perimysium and endomysium. Together, these three ECM structures make up the intramuscular connective tissue (IMCT). There are large variations in the amount and composition of IMCT between functionally different muscles. Although IMCT acts as a scaffold for muscle ﬁber development and growth and acts as a carrier for blood vessels and nerves to the muscle cells, the variability in IMCT between different muscles points to a role in the variations in active and passive mechanical properties of muscles. Some traditional measures of the contribution of endomysial IMCT to passive muscle elasticity relied upon tensile measurements on single ﬁber preparations. These types of measurements may now be thought to be missing the important point that endomysial IMCT networks within a muscle fascicle coordinate forces and displacements between adjacent muscle cells by shear and that active contractile forces can be transmitted by this route (myofascial force transmission). The amount and geometry of the perimysial ECM network separating muscle fascicles varies more between different muscle than does the amount of endomysium. While there is some evidence for myofascial force transmission between fascicles via the perimysium, the variations in this ECM network appears to be linked to the amount of shear displacements between fascicles that must necessarily occur when the whole muscle contracts and changes shape. Fast growth of muscle by ﬁber hypertrophy is not always associated with a high turnover of ECM components, but slower rates of growth and muscle wasting may be associated with IMCT remodeling. A hypothesis arising from this observation is that the level of cell signaling via shear between integrin and dystroglycan linkages on the surface of the muscle cells and the overlying endomysium may be the controlling factor for IMCT turnover, although this idea is yet to be tested.},

We hypothesize that upon muscle activation, formation of actomyosin crossbridges reduces the force on titin causing entropic recoil of the titin polymer and triggering the folding of the titin Ig domains. In the physiological force range of 4–15 pN under which titin operates in muscle, the folding contraction of a single Ig domain can generate 200\% of the work of entropic recoil, and occurs at forces which exceed the maximum stalling force of single myosin motors. Thus titin operates like a mechanical battery storing elastic energy efficiently by unfolding Ig domains, and delivering the charge back by folding when the motors are activated during a contraction. We advance the hypothesis that titin folding and myosin activation act as inextricable partners during muscle contraction.},

	abstract = {Human skeletal muscles have different fiber types with distinct metabolic functions and physiological properties. The quantitative metabolic responses of muscle fibers to exercise provide essential information for understanding and modifying the regulatory mechanisms of skeletal muscle. Since in vivo data from skeletal muscle during exercise is limited, a computational, physiologically based model has been developed to quantify the dynamic metabolic responses of many key chemical species. This model distinguishes type I and II muscle fibers, which share the same blood supply. An underlying hypothesis is that the recruitment and metabolic activation of the two main types of muscle fibers differ depending on the pre-exercise state and exercise protocols. Here, activation measured by metabolic response (or enzymatic activation) in single fibers is considered linked but distinct from fiber recruitment characterized by the number (or mass) of each fiber type involved during a specific exercise. The model incorporates species transport processes between blood and muscle fibers and most of the important reactions/pathways in cytosol and mitochondria within each fiber type. Model simulations describe the dynamics of intracellular species concentrations and fluxes in muscle fibers during moderate intensity exercise according to various experimental protocols and conditions. This model is validated by comparing model simulations with experimental data in single muscle fibers and in whole muscle. Model simulations demonstrate that muscle-fiber recruitment and metabolic activation patterns in response to exercise produce significantly distinctive effects depending on the exercise conditions.},

Although the cross-bridge theory of muscle contraction provides a good explanation for the increase in force in active muscle lengthening, it does not explain the residual increase in force following active lengthening (residual force enhancement), or except with additional assumptions, the reduced metabolic requirement of muscle during and following active stretch. Aside from the cross-bridge theory, 2 other primary explanations for the mechanical properties of actively stretched muscles have emerged: (1) the so-called sarcomere length nonuniformity theory and (2) the engagement of a passive structural element theory. In this article, these theories are discussed, and it is shown that the last of these—the engagement of a passive structural element in eccentric muscle action—offers a simple and complete explanation for many hitherto unexplained observations in actively lengthening muscle. Although by no means fully proven, the theory has great appeal for its simplicity and beauty, and even if over time it is shown to be wrong, it nevertheless forms a useful framework for direct hypothesis testing.},

Recent work suggests that the titin spring contributes to muscle contraction in a more active manner than previously thought. In this review, we highlight this property, specifically the ability of the immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains of titin to undergo unfolding-refolding transitions when isolated titin molecules or skeletal myofibrils are held at physiological force levels. Folding of titin Ig domains under force is a hitherto unappreciated, putative source of work production in muscle cells, which could work in synergy with the actomyosin system to maximize the energy delivered by a stretched, actively contracting muscle. This review also focuses on the mechanisms shown to modulate titin-based viscoelastic forces in skeletal muscle cells, including chaperone binding, titin oxidation, phosphorylation, Ca

              binding, and interaction with actin filaments. Along the way, we discuss which of these modulatory mechanisms might contribute to the phenomenon of residual force enhancement relevant for eccentric muscle contractions. Finally, a brief perspective is added on the potential for the alterations in titin-based force to dynamically alter mechano-chemical signaling pathways in the muscle cell. We conclude that titin from skeletal muscle is a determinant of both passive and active tension and a bona fide mechanosensor, whose stiffness is tuned by various independent mechanisms.},

In mechanical terms, it can be viewed as a collective folding-unfolding phenomenon in the system of interacting bi-stable units and modeled by near equilibrium Langevin dynamics. The parallel active force generation mechanism operates at slow time scales, requires detachment and is crucially dependent on ATP hydrolysis. The underlying mechanical processes take place far from equilibrium and are represented by stochastic models with broken time reversal symmetry implying non-potentiality, correlated noise or multiple reservoirs. The modeling approaches reviewed in this paper deal with both active and passive processes and support from the mechanical perspective the biological point of view that phenomena involved in slow (active) and fast (passive) force generation are tightly intertwined. They reveal, however, that biochemical studies in solution, macroscopic physiological measurements and structural analysis do not provide by themselves all the necessary insights into the functioning of the organized contractile system. In particular, the reviewed body of work emphasizes the important role of long-range interactions and criticality in securing the targeted mechanical response in the physiological regime of isometric contractions. The importance of the purely mechanical micro-scale modeling is accentuated at the end of the paper where we address the puzzling issue of the stability of muscle response on the so called “descending limb” of the isometric tetanus.},

	abstract = {Musculoskeletal simulations are used in many different applications, ranging from the design of wearable robots that interact with humans to the analysis of patients with impaired movement. Here, we introduce OpenSim Moco, a software toolkit for optimizing the motion and control of musculoskeletal models built in the OpenSim modeling and simulation package. OpenSim Moco uses the direct collocation method, which is often faster and can handle more diverse problems than other methods for musculoskeletal simulation. Moco frees researchers from implementing direct collocation themselves—which typically requires extensive technical expertise—and allows them to focus on their scientific questions. The software can handle a wide range of problems that interest biomechanists, including motion tracking, motion prediction, parameter optimization, model fitting, electromyography-driven simulation, and device design. Moco is the first musculoskeletal direct collocation tool to handle kinematic constraints, which enable modeling of kinematic loops (e.g., cycling models) and complex anatomy (e.g., patellar motion). To show the abilities of Moco, we first solved for muscle activity that produced an observed walking motion while minimizing squared muscle excitations and knee joint loading. Next, we predicted how muscle weakness may cause deviations from a normal walking motion. Lastly, we predicted a squat-to-stand motion and optimized the stiffness of an assistive device placed at the knee. We designed Moco to be easy to use, customizable, and extensible, thereby accelerating the use of simulations to understand the movement of humans and other animals.},

              Context
              There is renewed interest in using very low-carbohydrate ketogenic (VLCK) diets to manage diabetes. Many clinical trials have been published, often with mixed results.
            
            
              Objective
              This meta-analysis compares the effect of a VLCK diet on glycemic control, body weight, lipid profile, medication use, and dropouts with that of recommended diets for 12 weeks or longer in people with type 2 diabetes.
            
            
              Data Sources
              Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, CENTRAL, and CINAHL databases were searched (January 1980 through September 2019).
            
            
              Study Selection
              Two authors independently reviewed search results to select randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing a VLCK diet (carbohydrate intake \&lt; 50 g/d or \&lt; 10\% of total energy) with any recommended diet for type 2 diabetes in adults. Discrepancies were resolved after consulting with the third author.
            
            
              Data Extraction
              Eight RCTs with 648 participants were identified.
            
            
              Results
              Compared with control diets, the VLCK diet resulted in a greater decrease in hemoglobin A1c after 3 months (weighted mean difference[WMD]: −6.7 mmol/mol; 95\%CI, −9.0 to −4.4) (WMD: −0.61\%; 95\%CI, −0.82 to −0.40; P \&lt; 0.001; moderate-certainty evidence) and after 6 months (WMD: −6.3 mmol/mol; 95\%CI, −9.3 to −3.5) (WMD: −0.58\%; 95\%CI, −0.85 to −0.32; low-certainty evidence). There was a significantly greater weight loss with the VLCK diet after 3 months (WMD: −2.91 kg; 95\%CI, −4.88 to −0.95; low-certainty evidence) and after 6 months (WMD: −2.84 kg; 95\%CI, −5.29 to −0.39; low-certainty evidence). The VLCK diet was not better than a control diet after 12 months. It was superior in decreasing triglyceride levels, increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and reducing the use of antidiabetic medications for up to 12 months.
            
            
              Conclusion
              The VLCK diet appears to control glycemia and decrease body weight for up to 6 months in people with obesity and diabetes. Beneficial changes in serum triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, along with reductions in antidiabetic medications, continued in the VLCK group until 12 months. However, the quality of currently available evidence is not sufficient to recommend VLCK diets. A major limitation of the VLCK diet is patients’ lack of adherence to carbohydrate restriction.

	abstract = {Very low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) has been proposed as a promising option to achieve a significant weight loss in a short time period. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate its efficacy and safety in patients with overweight and obesity. Four databases were searched on May 2019. Studies reporting data on body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, body composition, blood pressure, HbA1c, lipids, and markers of liver and kidney function were selected. Discontinuation was also assessed. Twelve studies were included. VLCKD was associated with weight losses of −10.0 kg (I2 = 6\%) and − 15.6 kg (I2 = 37\%) in studies with a ketogenic phase up to and of at least four weeks, respectively. The weight lost during the ketogenic phase was stable in the subsequent follow-up up to two years (p = 0.12). Also, VLCKD was associated with reductions of BMI (−5.3 kg/m2), waist circumference (−12.6 cm), HbA1c (−0.7\%), total cholesterol (−28 mg/dl), triglycerides (−30 mg/dl), AST (−7 U/l), ALT (−8 U/l), GGT (−8 U/l), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (−8 and − 7 mmHg, respectively). No changes in LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, serum creatinine, serum uric acid and serum potassium were found. Serum sodium increased during VLCKD (+1.6 mEq/l). The overall prevalence of patients discontinuing VLCKD was 7.5\% and this was similar to patients undergoing a low calorie diet (p = 0.83). The present review supports the use of VLCKD as an effective strategy for the management of overweight and obesity. Future guidelines should include a specific recommendation for this intervention.},

	abstract = {Background: At present, the beneﬁcial effect of the ketogenic diet (KD) on weight loss in obese patients is generally recognized. However, a systematic research on the role of KD in the improvement of glycemic and lipid metabolism of patients with diabetes is still found scarce.
Methods: This meta-study employed the meta-analysis model of random effects or of ﬁxed effects to analyze the average difference before and after KD and the corresponding 95\% CI, thereby evaluating the effect of KD on T2DM.
Results: After KD intervention, in terms of glycemic control, the level of fasting blood glucose decreased by 1.29 mmol/L (95\% CI: −1.78 to −0.79) on average, and glycated hemoglobin A1c by 1.07 (95\% CI: −1.37 to −0.78). As for lipid metabolism, triglyceride was decreased by 0.72 (95\% CI: −1.01 to −0.43) on average, total cholesterol by 0.33 (95\% CI: −0.66 to −0.01), and low-density lipoprotein by 0.05 (95\% CI: −0.25 to −0.15); yet, high-density lipoprotein increased by 0.14 (95\% CI: 0.03−0.25). In addition, patients’ weight decreased by 8.66 (95\% CI: −11.40 to −5.92), waist circumference by 9.17 (95\% CI: −10.67 to −7.66), and BMI by 3.13 (95\% CI: −3.31 to −2.95).
Conclusion: KD not only has a therapeutic effect on glycemic and lipid control among patients with T2DM but also signiﬁcantly contributes to their weight loss. 1234567890():,;},

Fourteen studies were included in meta-analysis.

	abstract = {\textbf{\textit{Background:}} The very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) has been recently proposed as an appealing nutritional strategy for obesity management. The VLCKD is characterized by a low carbohydrate content (\&\#x3c;50 g/day), 1–1.5 g of protein/kg of ideal body weight, 15–30 g of fat/day, and a daily intake of about 500–800 calories. \textbf{\textit{Objectives:}} The aim of the current document is to suggest a common protocol for VLCKD and to summarize the existing literature on its efficacy in weight management and weight-related comorbidities, as well as the possible side effects. \textbf{\textit{Methods:}} This document has been prepared in adherence with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Literature searches, study selection, methodology development, and quality appraisal were performed independently by 2 authors and the data were collated by means of a meta-analysis and narrative synthesis. \textbf{\textit{Results:}} Of the 645 articles retrieved, 15 studies met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed, revealing 4 main findings. First, the VLCKD was shown to result in a significant weight loss in the short, intermediate, and long terms and improvement in body composition parameters as well as glycemic and lipid profiles. Second, when compared with other weight loss interventions of the same duration, the VLCKD showed a major effect on reduction of body weight, fat mass, waist circumference, total cholesterol and triglyceridemia as well as improved insulin resistance. Third, although the VLCKD also resulted in a significant reduction of glycemia, HbA1c, and LDL cholesterol, these changes were similar to those obtained with other weight loss interventions. Finally, the VLCKD can be considered a safe nutritional approach under a health professional’s supervision since the most common side effects are usually clinically mild and easily to manage and recovery is often spontaneous. \textbf{\textit{Conclusions:}} The VLCKD can be recommended as an effective dietary treatment for individuals with obesity after considering potential contra-indications and keeping in mind that any dietary treatment has to be personalized. \textbf{\textit{Prospero Registry:}} The assessment of the efficacy of VLCKD on body weight, body composition, glycemic and lipid parameters in overweight and obese subjects: a meta-analysis (CRD42020205189).},

However, it remains uncertain how the macronutrient intake shift from carbohydrate to fat affects endurance exercise training and performance. This study performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the effects of a ketogenic low-carbohydrate, high-fat (K-LCHF) diet on aerobic capacity and exercise performance among endurance athletes. Searches were carried out in ﬁve electronic databases, and we followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The search included studies using an LCHF diet as an intervention protocol and compared data on factors such as maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) from the graded exercise test. In this case, 10 studies met the criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. We did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant effect of K-LCHF diet interventions on VO2max, time to exhaustion, HRmax or RPE. However, a signiﬁcant overall effect in the substrate oxidation response to respiratory exchange rate was observed. The meta-analysis showed that K-LCHF diets did not affect aerobic capacity and exercise performance. Therefore, high-quality interventions of a K-LCHF diet are needed to illustrate its effect on various endurance training programs.},

	abstract = {Statistical inference often fails to replicate. One reason is that many results may be selected for drawing inference because some threshold of a statistic like the P-value was crossed, leading to biased reported effect sizes. Nonetheless, considerable non-replication is to be expected even without selective reporting, and generalizations from single studies are rarely if ever warranted. Honestly reported results must vary from replication to replication because of varying assumption violations and random variation; excessive agreement itself would suggest deeper problems, such as failure to publish results in conflict with group expectations or desires. A general perception of a “replication crisis” may thus reflect failure to recognize that statistical tests not only test hypotheses, but countless assumptions and the entire environment in which research takes place. Because of all the uncertain and unknown assumptions that underpin statistical inferences, we should treat inferential statistics as highly unstable local descriptions of relations between assumptions and data, rather than as providing generalizable inferences about hypotheses or models. And that means we should treat statistical results as being much more incomplete and uncertain than is currently the norm. Acknowledging this uncertainty could help reduce the allure of selective reporting: Since a small P-value could be large in a replication study, and a large P-value could be small, there is simply no need to selectively report studies based on statistical results. Rather than focusing our study reports on uncertain conclusions, we should thus focus on describing accurately how the study was conducted, what problems occurred, what data were obtained, what analysis methods were used and why, and what output those methods produced.},

	abstract = {Statistical modeling methods are widely used in clinical science, epidemiology, and health services research to analyze data that has been collected in clinical trials as well as observational studies of existing data sources, such as claims files and electronic health records. Diagnostic and prognostic inferences from statistical models are critical to researchers advancing science, clinical practitioners making patient care decisions, and administrators and policy makers impacting the health care system to improve quality and reduce costs. The veracity of such inferences relies not only on the quality and completeness of the collected data, but also statistical model validity. A key component of establishing model validity is determining when a model is not correctly specified and therefore incapable of adequately representing the Data Generating Process (DGP). In this article, model validity is first described and methods designed for assessing model fit, specification, and selection are reviewed. Second, data transformations that improve the model’s ability to represent the DGP are addressed. Third, model search and validation methods are discussed. Finally, methods for evaluating predictive and classification performance are presented. Together, these methods provide a practical framework with recommendations to guide the development and evaluation of statistical models that provide valid statistical inferences.},

Humans adjust our behaviors by anticipating what will happen if we act in different ways, using past experiences to inform these choices. ‘Essential’ here means in the mathematical sense of excluding the unnecessary and including only the necessary, e.g. stating that the Pythagorean theorem works for an isosceles right triangle is bad mathematics because it includes the unnecessary adjective isosceles; of course this is not as bad as omitting the adjective ‘right.’ I find much of what is written about causal inference to be mathematically inapposite in one of these senses because the descriptions either include irrelevant clutter or omit conditions required for the correctness of the assertions. The history of formal causal inference is remarkable because its correct formulation is so recent, a twentieth century phenomenon, and its future is intriguing because it is currently undeveloped when applied to investigate interventions applied to conscious humans, and moreover will utilize tools impossible without modern computing.},

Studies on animals and isolated neuronal cells have revealed that adaptogens exhibit neuroprotective, anti-fatigue, antidepressive, anxiolytic, nootropic and CNS stimulating activity. In addition, a number of clinical trials demonstrate that adaptogens exert an anti-fatigue effect that increases mental work capacity against a background of stress and fatigue, particularly in tolerance to mental exhaustion and enhanced attention. Indeed, recent pharmacological studies of a number of adaptogens have provided a rationale for these effects also at the molecular level. It was discovered that the stress—protective activity of adaptogens was associated with regulation of homeostasis via several mechanisms of action, which was linked with the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis and the regulation of key mediators of stress response, such as molecular chaperons (e.g., HSP70), stress-activated c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase 1 (JNK1), Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factor DAF-16, cortisol and nitric oxide.},

	doi = {10.4085/1062-6050-48.1.12},
	abstract = {Context
              Recently, researchers have shown that phototherapy administered to skeletal muscle immediately before resistance exercise can enhance contractile function, prevent exercise-induced cell damage, and improve postexercise recovery of strength and function.
            
            
              Objective
              To critically evaluate original research addressing the ability of phototherapeutic devices, such as lasers and light-emitting diodes (LEDs), to enhance skeletal muscle contractile function, reduce exercise-induced muscle fatigue, and facilitate postexercise recovery.
            
            
              Data Sources
              We searched the electronic databases PubMed, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, Scopus, and Rehabilitation \& Physical Medicine without date limitations for the following key words: laser therapy, phototherapy, fatigue, exercise, circulation, microcirculation, and photobiomodulation.
            
            
              Study Selection
              Eligible studies had to be original research published in English as full papers, involve human participants, and receive a minimum score of 7 out of 10 on the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale.
            
            
              Data Extraction
              Data of interest included elapsed time to fatigue, total number of repetitions to fatigue, total work performed, maximal voluntary isometric contraction (strength), electromyographic activity, and postexercise biomarker levels. We recorded the PEDro scores, beam characteristics, and treatment variables and calculated the therapeutic outcomes and effect sizes for the data sets.
            
            
              Data Synthesis
              In total, 12 randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. However, we excluded data from 2 studies, leaving 32 data sets from 10 studies. Twenty-four of the 32 data sets contained differences between active phototherapy and sham (placebo-control) treatment conditions for the various outcome measures. Exposing skeletal muscle to single-diode and multidiode laser or multidiode LED therapy was shown to positively affect physical performance by delaying the onset of fatigue, reducing the fatigue response, improving postexercise recovery, and protecting cells from exercise-induced damage.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Phototherapy administered before resistance exercise consistently has been found to provide ergogenic and prophylactic benefits to skeletal muscle.},

	abstract = {Neuromuscular fatigue is deﬁned as a reduction induced by exercise in the maximal voluntary force that a muscle or group of muscles can generate. An accumulation of work or an incomplete force restoration can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the neuromuscular performance in both the short and long terms. Thus, fatigue management is essential for controlling the training adaptations of athletes and reducing their susceptibility to injury and illness. The main individualized monitoring tools used to describe fatigue are questionnaires and subjective assessments of fatigue, biochemical markers, sprint tests, and vertical jump tests. Among the subjective measures, the rating of the perceived exertion has been widely used because of its simplicity and high validity. In terms of the objective measures, one of the more frequently employed tools by practitioners to assess neuromuscular fatigue is the countermovement jump. Because of its high validity and reliability, it is accepted as the reference standard test in sports, in general, and particularly in team sports. Our review aims to clarify how all these indicators, as well as several devices, can help coaches in different sports contexts to monitor neuromuscular fatigue, and how these procedures should be used to obtain data that can be used to make decisions in complex environments.},

Secondary data from a human subject experiment validates the existence of perception of complexity as a context-dependent factor that inﬂuences required design eﬀort. A two-level mixed eﬀects regression model quantiﬁes diﬀerences in perception among 40 design groups. Results summarize how perception of complexity may contribute to eﬀort overruns and outline future work to further validate the explanatory model and causal mechanisms.},

	abstract = {This chapter explores the issues with complexity by considering the possibility that the system design community has been struggling with the consequences of a ―big assumption‖ concerning our core definition of a system. According to Kegan and Lahey, ―big assumptions‖ represent tenets in people‘s ―mental construction‖ of the world that are viewed as accurate representations of the way things are and are ―uncritically taken as true.‖ However, when these assumptions are not true, they create a barrier to success by impeding the ability to adapt appropriately [(1)]. The intent of this chapter is to support an alternative treatment of complexity in system design by extracting our community‘s viewpoint—the mental construction we perceive the world through—such that we are able to look at it objectively. To do so, the chapter frames a normative comparative study intended to assess the ability of any design viewpoint to successfully facilitate system design. The evaluative criteria are the assurance of the design process and the correctness and completeness of the solution to resolve the need. The study compares the prevailing viewpoint derived from the ―big assumption‖ to a viewpoint built around an alternative view of systems. The results show that the prevailing viewpoint agreement with the evaluative criteria becomes increasingly unsatisfactory as systems exceed the capability and capacity of the practitioner to comprehend, and therefore brings into question the validity of the “big assumption”. The analysis further suggests that the systems community has been actively compensating for the insufficiency of its models, which can create a perception of complexity as significant to design. On the other hand, the alternative viewpoint demonstrates theoretical agreement with the evaluative criteria and shows the potential for systematic solution derivation, suggesting that the alternate definition of systems might form a more suitable basis for the design of “complex” systems. The seemingly insurmountable problems we experience with the burden of ―complexity‖ may have a path to resolution, but only if we choose to accept the implications that our struggles may be self-imposed.},

We conducted an experimental study in a sample of 28 healthy men between 20 and 30 yr of age (power: 95\%, α: 5\%). Smokers, obese subjects, and those who performed regular physical activity over a certain amount of energetic expenditure were excluded from the study. The participants exerted two types of isometric contractions: handgrip and turning a 40-cm-diameter wheel. Both were sustained to exhaustion at 20 and 50\% of maximal force. Twenty-five subjects finished the experiment. Heart rate increased a mean of 15.1 beats/min [95\% confidence interval (CI): 5.5–24.6] from 20 to 50\% handgrip contractions, and 20.7 beats/min (95\% CI: 11.9–29.5) from 20 to 50\% wheel-turn contractions. Heart rate also increased a mean of 13.3 beats/min (95\% CI: 10.4–16.1) from handgrip to wheel-turn contractions at 20\% maximal force, and 18.9 beats/min (95\% CI: 9.8–28.0) from handgrip to wheel-turn contractions at 50\% maximal force. We conclude that the magnitude of the heart rate increase during isometric exercise is related to the intensity of the contraction and the mass of the contracted muscle.},

	abstract = {Several clinical treatments have been proposed to manage symptoms of fibromyalgia. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) may be a useful tool to treat this dysfunction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of LLLT in patients with fibromyalgia. A placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial was carried out with 20 patients divided randomly into either an LLLT group (n=10) or a placebo group (n=10). The LLLT group was treated with a GaAlAs laser (670 nm, 4 J/ cm2 on 18 tender points) three times a week over 4 weeks. Before and after treatment, patients were evaluated with the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), McGill Pain Questionnaire, and visual analog scale (VAS). Data from the FIQ and McGill questionnaire for the treated and control groups were analyzed by paired t tests, and Wilcoxon tests were used to analyze data from the VAS. After LLLT or sham treatment, the number of tender points was significantly reduced in both groups (LLLT, p{\textless}0.0001; placebo, p=0.0001). However, all other fibromyalgia symptoms showed significant improvements after LLLT compared to placebo (FIQ, p=0.0003; McGill, p=0.0078; and VAS, p=0.0020). LLLT provided relief from fibromyalgia symptoms in patients and should be further investigated as a therapeutic tool for management in fibromyalgia.},

Quantum physics describes the behaviour of the nanoscale particles that make up all matter including living organisms, but it was generally believed that the ‘warm, wet and noisy environment’ in living organisms would result in decoherence making it impossible for meaningful quantum effects to occur. However, there is now a substantial body of work supporting that nature has actually adapted in such a way as to exploit quantum properties to enhance cellular functioning and is believed to have role in a diverse range of key processes in living organisms ranging from maintaining the stability of DNA to neuron function to conscious cognition; from light harvesting in photosynthesis to avian magnetic field based navigation. This review aims to summarize the various mechanisms and functions in living organisms believed to utilize quantum mechanics to purposefully and effectively enhance their performance, and to explore the potential this could hold in diagnosing and treating various medical conditions.},

These require a new study design structure, related to a new level of theory that goes beyond the current single-factor, a-theoretic epidemiological studies. This new platform for the design of large-scale Work/Stress/Disease studies would assess CVD-related disease mechanisms in a more general and dynamic form, based on the use of new tools for measuring autonomic functions in an occupational stress context and a new theory of disease causation. A sample outline is presented for such a study, based on Stress-Disequilibrium Theory (SDT) hypotheses, building on analytic tools developed for the assessment of stress-related exhaustion effects and chronic disease risks from Heart Rate Variability (HRV) research studies. The goal is to assess the associations between social organizational risks, particularly at work, and hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes II. The study design is multi-stage, spanning across several levels of disease-related de-regulation, and addressing co-morbidity of the conditions themselves. The study design is meant to span across a broad social population at all levels and would probably be multi-site, involving several countries, to yield the larger sample increased power for finding associations for work - physiological effects.},

Electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) data was collected from 22 subjects in supine and upright positions. Comparison of parameters in supine and upright positions revealed that every parameter was effected by orthostatic stress. High frequency power of HRV showed the largest response (75\%), while QRS duration had the smallest response of (7\%). We found that gender played a significant role in PTT, R-R interval and QRS duration values, with male subjects showing higher values of all three parameters. Subject height also played a distinguishing role, with taller subjects showing higher values of R-R interval and PTT. The results allow us to better understand the interaction between various parameters and how they reflect the hemodynamic changes caused by orthostatic stress.},

	doi = {10.2478/v10001-010-0023-6},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This paper has two primary objectives. First, the paper proposes methodological strategies for analyzing multiscale vagal cardiac control based on the Stress Disequilibrium Theory (SDT) using high frequency power of heart rate variability (HFP) and short term variance of HFP. Second, the paper provides evidence of reduced vagal cardiac control range and variability in high strain job and exhausted subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Job Strain was measured using the Job Content Questionnaire, 8/day diary reports, and a nationally standardized occupational code linkage in 36 healthy mid-aged males with varying strain jobs. Subjects were Holter-monitored for 48 hours, including a work and rest day. Subjects responded to questions on a daily diary as well as on the Job Content Questionnaire to test for exhaustion as a dichotomous state variable. Vagal cardiac control was measured by components of electrocardiograph: heart rate variability based measures of high frequency power (HFP). We assessed range of vagal cardiac control using extreme value analysis (data in upper tail); and short term vagal variability using Poincaré plots of HFP. Comparisons were made between high (N = 10) and low job strain (N = 22) jobs. Furthermore, subjects categorized as exhausted (N = 4) were separately analyzed. RESULTS: Exhausted subjects displayed a reduced range of vagal cardiac control on the workday; and both high strain and exhausted subjects displayed reduced short-term variance in vagal cardiac control. A repeated measures ANOVA controlling for age confirms reductions in variance of cardiac vagal activity in high job strain subjects (0.01), with further reductions in subjects reporting exhaustion (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: This analysis supports the hypothesis that (a) job strain is associated with reductions in cardiac vagal - or system level - variance; and (b) that reduced system variability may be a characteristic of exhaustion.},

This, in turn, would help to more precisely identify risk. Methods: We measured Job Strain using the Job Content Questionnaire, 8/day diary reports, and nationally standardized occupational code linkage, as well as autonomic regulation utilizing heart rate variability including spectral-derived components and QT interval variability in 36 healthy mid-aged males with varying strain jobs. The subjects wore Holter-monitors for 48 hr; this included a work and rest day. Results: Job strain (P = 0.02) and low decision latitude (P = 0.004) were associated with a reduction in cardiac vagal control (HFP) persisting throughout the 48 hr. Job strain was also associated with elevations in sympathetic control during working hours (P = 0.003). Conclusions: The disturbed cardiovascular regulatory pattern associated with job strain may help explain the increased risk of cardiovascular diseases linked with occupational exposure. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Design: Qualitative study using a focus group technique. Subjects: Thirty-four patients (23 women, age range 26-70 years) with chronic neck or low back pain who had participated in a home exercise programme. Methods: Seven focus groups were formed. Participants were sampled purposefully from all patients with chronic neck or low back pain who attended for physiotherapy at 4 primary healthcare centres. Patients were interviewed about how they perceived their adherence to a home exercise programme during chronic pain. Data were analysed using a phenomenographic method. Results: Several themes about patients' beliefs and perceptions were identified as factors related to adherence. These factors change when pain or disabilities appear, decrease or disappear for an extended period. Beliefs about illness and treatment are more likely when pain is present and when pain disappears for an extended period. However, patients consider perceptions about barriers, social support and physical environment when pain decreases. Conclusion: These findings may represent an important potential for improving the adherence of patients with chronic pain to home exercise programmes. © 2009 The Authors.

	abstract = {Mining temporal data for information is often inhibited by a multitude of formats: irregular or multiple time intervals, point events that need aggregating, multiple observational units or repeated measurements on multiple individuals, and heterogeneous data types. On the other hand, the software supporting time series modeling and forecasting, makes strict assumptions on the data to be provided, typically requiring a matrix of numeric data with implicit time indexes. Going from raw data to model-ready data is painful. This work presents a cohesive and conceptual framework for organizing and manipulating temporal data, which in turn ﬂows into visualization, modeling and forecasting routines. Tidy data principles are extended to temporal data by: (1) mapping the semantics of a dataset into its physical layout; (2) including an explicitly declared index variable representing time; (3) incorporating a “key” comprising single or multiple variables to uniquely identify units over time. This tidy data representation most naturally supports thinking of operations on the data as building blocks, forming part of a “data pipeline” in time-based contexts. A sound data pipeline facilitates a ﬂuent workﬂow for analyzing temporal data. The infrastructure of tidy temporal data has been implemented in the R package tsibble.},

	abstract = {Background: In previous work, RAF theory has been developed as a tool for making theoretical progress on the origin of life question, providing insight into the structure and occurrence of self-sustaining and collectively autocatalytic sets within catalytic polymer networks. We present here an extension in which there are two “independent” polymer sets, where catalysis occurs within and between the sets, but there are no reactions combining polymers from both sets. Such an extension reflects the interaction between nucleic acids and peptides observed in modern cells and proposed forms of early life.
Results: We present theoretical work and simulations which suggest that the occurrence of autocatalytic sets is robust to the partitioned structure of the network. We also show that autocatalytic sets remain likely even when the molecules in the system are not polymers, and a low level of inhibition is present. Finally, we present a kinetic extension which assigns a rate to each reaction in the system, and show that identifying autocatalytic sets within such a system is an NP-complete problem.
Conclusions: Recent experimental work has challenged the necessity of an RNA world by suggesting that peptide-nucleic acid interactions occurred early in chemical evolution. The present work indicates that such a peptide-RNA world could support the spontaneous development of autocatalytic sets and is thus a feasible alternative worthy of investigation.},

Feedback control mechanisms that provide this type of restraint work through homeostatic regulators that transmit information through a corresponding syntax that is uniquely their own. The language is coded into electromagnetic information that is of a reference nature (genetic, adaptive or conditioned), sensory (informative) or motor (causative), and which is transmitted as action potentials that have a functional dependence on the error signal and a parametric dependence on the disturbing signal. The analysis of homeostasis within the context of feedback control theory reduces seemingly complex, unrelated sequences of physiologic processes into more readily identifiable sets of common denominators that illucidate some basic principles of biologic function. Appropriate interpretation of these biologic principles may help us move closer to success in our efforts to improve the health. comfort and understanding of man. This is because the specific details of complex physiologic processes may be viewed as simply special cases (or different sets of boundary conditions) of a unified guiding theory.},

As a discipline, systems biology shares many characteristics with engineering. However, before the benefits of engineering-based modeling formalisms and analysis tools can be applied to systems biology, the engineering discipline(s) most related to systems biology must be identified. In this paper, we identify the cell as an embedded computing system and, as such, demonstrate that systems biology shares many aspects in common with computer systems engineering, electrical engineering, and chemical engineering. This realization solidifies the grounds for using modeling formalisms from these engineering subdisciplines to be applied to biological systems. While we document several examples where this is already happening, our goal is that identifying the cell as an embedded computing system would motivate and facilitate further discovery through more widespread use of the modeling formalisms described here.},

In this review, we describe a kinetic model based on the concept of dynamic kinetic stability that attempts to incorporate living systems within a conventional physicochemical framework. Its essence: all replicating systems, both animate and inanimate, represent elements of a replicator space. However, in contrast to the world of nonreplicating systems (all inanimate), where selection is fundamentally thermodynamic, selection within replicator space is effectively kinetic. As a consequence, the nature of stability within the two spaces is of a distinctly different kind, which, in turn, leads to different physicochemical patterns of aggregation. Our kinetic approach suggests: (a) that all living systems may be thought of as manifesting a kinetic state of matter (as apposed to the traditional thermodynamic states associated with inanimate systems), and (b) that key Darwinian concepts, such as fitness and natural selection, are particular expressions of more fundamental physicochemical concepts, such as kinetic stability and kinetic selection. The approach appears to provide an improved basis for understanding the physicochemical process of complexification by which life on earth emerged, as well as a means of relating life’s defining characteristics—its extraordinary complexity, its far-from-equilibrium character, and its purposeful (teleonomic) nature—to the nature of that process of complexification.},

	abstract = {It is widely assumed in developmental biology and bioengineering that optimal understanding and control of complex living systems follows from models of molecular events. The success of reductionism has overshadowed attempts at top-down models and control policies in biological systems. However, other fields, including physics, engineering and neuroscience, have successfully used the explanations and models at higher levels of organization, including least-action principles in physics and control-theoretic models in computational neuroscience. Exploiting the dynamic regulation of pattern formation in embryogenesis and regeneration requires new approaches to understand how cells cooperate towards large-scale anatomical goal states. Here, we argue that top-down models of pattern homeostasis serve as proof of principle for extending the current paradigm beyond emergence and molecule-level rules. We define top-down control in a biological context, discuss the examples of how cognitive neuroscience and physics exploit these strategies, and illustrate areas in which they may offer significant advantages as complements to the mainstream paradigm. By targeting system controls at multiple levels of organization and demystifying goal-directed (cybernetic) processes, top-down strategies represent a roadmap for using the deep insights of other fields for transformative advances in regenerative medicine and systems bioengineering.},

In this perspective it is proposed that the two sciences can be directly connected through the fundamental concept of stability. Physicochemical stability is shown to have a logical, rather than an empirical basis, and able to manifest itself in two distinct and often contrary ways, one thermodynamic, reflecting energetic considerations, and the other kinetic, reflecting time/persistence considerations. Each stability kind is shown to rest on a particular mathematical truism. Thermodynamic stability, the energetic expression, has a probabilistic/statistical basis due to Boltzmann, and leads to the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Dynamic kinetic stability (DKS), the time/persistence expression, is attributed to the stability associated with persistent replicating systems, and derives from the mathematics of exponential growth. The existence of two distinct stability kinds, each mathematically-based, leads to two distinct organizational forms of matter, animate and inanimate. That understanding offers insight into the reasons for the observation of just those two organizational forms, their different material characteristics, and provides a logical basis for understanding the nature of chemical and biological transformations, both within, and between, the two forms.},

	abstract = {Any living organism can be considered as a component of a dissipative process coupling an irreversible consumption of energy to the growth, reproduction and evolution of living things. Close interactions between metabolism and reproduction are thus required, which means that metabolism has two main functions. The first one, which is the most easily perceptible, corresponds to the synthesis of the components of living beings that are not found in the environment (anabolism). The second one, which is usually associated with the former, is the dissipative process coupling the consumption of energy to self-organization and reproduction and introducing irreversibility in the process. Considering the origin of life, the formation of at least some of the building blocks constituting a living organism can be envisaged in a close to equilibrium situation under reducing conditions (for instance in hydrothermal vents). However, coupling irreversibly self-organization with the dissipation of an energy flux implies far from equilibrium conditions that are shown in this work to raise quantitative requirements on the height of kinetic barriers protecting metabolites from a spontaneous evolution into deactivated species through a quantitative relationship with the time scale of the progress of the overall process and the absolute temperature. The thermodynamic potential of physical sources of energy capable of feeding the emergence of this capacity can be inferred, which leads to the identification of photochemistry at the wavelength of visible light or processes capable of generating activated species by heating transiently a chemical environment above several thousand Kelvin as the only processes capable of fulfilling this requirement.},

In the closed system, the slower replicator eventually prevails over the faster competitor. In a replication-destruction regime, implemented through a flow system, the outcome of the competition is reversed and the faster replicator dominates. The interpretation of the experimental observations is supported by a mass-action-kinetics model. These results represent one of the few experimental manifestations of selection among competing self-replicators based on dynamic kinetic stability and pave the way towards Darwinian evolution of abiotic systems.},

The model agrees well with genome-scale in vivo transposon mutagenesis experiments, showing a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.59. The genes in the reconstruction have a high in vivo essentiality or quasi-essentiality of 92\% (68\% essential), compared to 79\% in silico essentiality. This coherent model of the minimal metabolism in JCVI-syn3A at the same time also points toward specific open questions regarding the minimal genome of JCVI-syn3A, which still contains many genes of generic or completely unclear function. In particular, the model, its comparison to in vivo essentiality and proteomics data yield specific hypotheses on gene functions and metabolic capabilities; and provide suggestions for several further gene removals. In this way, the model and its accompanying data guide future investigations of the minimal cell. Finally, the identification of 30 essential genes with unclear function will motivate the search for new biological mechanisms beyond metabolism.},

We provide the first systems-level analysis searching for small-molecular autocatalytic components in the metabolisms of diverse organisms, including an inferred minimal metabolism.
Results: We find that intermediary metabolism is invariably autocatalytic for ATP. Furthermore, we provide evidence for the existence of additional, organism-specific autocatalytic metabolites in the forms of coenzymes (NAD+, coenzyme A, tetrahydrofolate, quinones) and sugars. Although the enzymatic reactions of a number of autocatalytic cycles are present in most of the studied organisms, they display obligatorily autocatalytic behavior in a few networks only, hence demonstrating the need for a systems-level approach to identify metabolic replicators embedded in large networks.
Conclusion: Metabolic replicators are apparently common and potentially both universal and ancestral: without their presence, kick-starting metabolic networks is impossible, even if all enzymes and genes are present in the same cell. Identification of metabolic replicators is also important for attempts to create synthetic cells, as some of these autocatalytic molecules will presumably be needed to be added to the system as, by definition, the system cannot synthesize them without their initial presence.},

	abstract = {Today most chemists think that the answer to how life on earth emerged is still unknown. They assume a gap between chemistry and biology that is still unbridged. For chemists, understanding the origin of life requires the experimental modeling of a process that bridges this gap. They will not consider the problem solved before they are able to perform such tasks. No gap appears when we are pursuing a less ambitious goal, namely, to present a sequence of hypothetical processes that lead to an apparatus with the basic structure and fundamental feature of the genetic apparatus of biosystems but strongly simplified. The modeled apparatus has the basic machinery of living entities. Its fundamental feature is Darwinian behavior. Living individuals have the power to evolve toward ever increasing complexity and intricacy if appropriate conditions are given. The task to understand life’s origin as a rational process is closely related to the earlier attempts of the present author to design and construct supra-molecular machines. The skill of the experimentalist has to be replaced by the presence of very particular conditions given by chance in a very particular location. The resulting apparatus has a distinct basic structure and function. The essence of what happens is inevitable, not accidental. Thus the emergence of life is assumed to be described by a distinct theory. Today’s great challenge is experimentally investigating chemical systems with the goal of creating artificial chemical life and the given theory provides a powerful stimulus. Life, from the perspective of physics, is the living state of matter and this view calls for a theory describing the fundamental requirements for the appearance of such a living state of matter (on the early earth and in the universe). The approach given here is an attempt in this direction. According to that approach the appearance of an entity with Darwinian behavior is instantaneous and linked with the creation of matter that carries information. Thus, Information (measured in bits according to Shannon) takes a meaning with that instant, the appearance of the first entity that evolves by multiplication, variation, selection and keeps that meaning during the entire evolution of the living (Information carrying) state of matter. Another consequence of this initial event is a spontaneous symmetry breaking due to the equal probabilities that the oligomer starting the process is right handed or left handed.},

Results: Here we show that coexistence of such diverse compositions and cell-types is the result of competitions for a variety of limited resources. We find that a transition to diversity occurs both in chemical compositions and in protocell types, as the resource supply is decreased, when the maximum inflow and consumption of resources are balanced.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that a simple physical principle of competition for a variety of limiting resources can be a strong driving force to diversify intracellular dynamics of a catalytic reaction network and to develop diverse protocell types in a primitive stage of life.},

The more general concept of collectively autocatalytic sets, formalized as RAF theory, does not explicitly include this notion of a boundary. Here, we argue that (1) the notion of a boundary can also be incorporated in the formal RAF framework, (2) this provides a mechanism for the emergence of higher-level autocatalytic sets, (3) this satisfies a necessary condition for the evolvability of autocatalytic sets, and (4) this enables the RAF framework to formally represent and analyze (at least in part) the other models. We suggest that RAF theory might thus provide a basis for a unifying formal framework for the further development and study of such models.},

Here, we argue that scale free patterns, found throughout nature, present convincing evidence that this demarcation is only imaginary. Therefore, all systems ought to be regarded alike, i.e., all are consuming free energy in least time. This way evolutionary processes can be understood as a series of changes from one state to another, so that flows of energy themselves naturally select those ways and means, such as species and societies or gadgets and galaxies to consume free energy in the least time in quest of attaining thermodynamic balance in respective surroundings. This holistic worldview, albeit an accurate account of nature, was shelved soon after its advent at the turn of the 18th century, because the general tenet did not meet that time expectations of a deterministic law, but now it is time to reconsider the old universal imperative against observations rather than expectations.},

	abstract = {Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), which offer systematic representations of causal relationships, have become an established framework for the analysis of causal inference in epidemiology, often being used to determine covariate adjustment sets for minimizing confounding bias. DAGitty is a popular web application for drawing and analysing DAGs. Here we introduce the R package ‘dagitty’, which provides access to all of the capabilities of the DAGitty web application within the R platform for statistical computing, and also offers several new functions. We describe how the R package ‘dagitty’ can be used to: evaluate whether a DAG is consistent with the dataset it is intended to represent; enumerate ‘statistically equivalent’ but causally different DAGs; and identify exposureoutcome adjustment sets that are valid for causally different but statistically equivalent DAGs. This functionality enables epidemiologists to detect causal misspeciﬁcations in DAGs and make robust inferences that remain valid for a range of different DAGs. The R package ‘dagitty’ is available through the comprehensive R archive network (CRAN) at [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dagitty/]. The source code is available on github at [https://github.com/jtextor/dagitty].

Resting HRV was collected using Polar Team2 monitors on 41 participants (age: 19.9 6 1.2 years; 28 females and 13 males) during 2 separate days. Within each session, participants performed 10 minutes each of spontaneous and controlled breathing (randomized order). Kubios HRV analysis software was used to analyze 180-second data epochs using “low” or “strong” artifact removal. Relative reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefﬁcient (ICC2,1), and absolute reliability was quantiﬁed using mean-normalized SEM\%. Timedomain and nonlinear parameters produced poor to good intersession agreement (ICC = 0.34–0.68; SEM\% = 11.0–39.0) with “low” artifact removal, regardless of breathing condition. Frequency-domain parameters demonstrated fair intersession agreement during controlled breathing (ICC = 0.40–0.45; SEM\% = 26.0–70.0) but poor agreement during spontaneous breathing (ICC = 0.07–0.13; SEM\% = 32.0–81.0). Minimal differences in ICCs were observed between “low” and “strong” artifact removal. Thus, this study provides 3 practical applications: (a) HRV monitoring is most reliable when using timedomain and nonlinear parameters, regardless of breathing or ﬁltering condition, but no single parameter is especially reliable.},

	abstract = {Objective: This paper proposes an approach to better estimate the sympathovagal balance (SB) and the respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) after separating respiratory inﬂuences from the heart rate (HR). Methods: The separation is performed using orthogonal subspace projections and the approach is ﬁrst tested using simulated HR and respiratory signals with different spectral properties. Then, RSA and SB are estimated during autonomic blockade and stress using the proposed approach and the classical heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. Both real and ECG-derived respiration (EDR) are used and the reliability of the EDR is evaluated. Results: Mean absolute percentage errors lower than 1\% were obtained after removing previously known respiratory signals from simulated HR. The proposed indices were able to improve the quantiﬁcation of SB during autonomic withdrawal. In the stress data, differences (p {\textless} 0.003) among relaxed and stressful phases were found with the proposed approach, using both the real respiration and the EDR, but they disappeared when using the classical HRV. Conclusion: A better assessment of the autonomic nervous system’ response to pharmacological blockade and stress can be achieved after removing respiratory inﬂuences from HR, and this can be done using either the real respiration or the EDR. Signiﬁcance: This work can be used to better identify vagal withdrawal and increased sympathetic activation when the classical HRV analysis fails due to the respiratory inﬂuences on HR. Furthermore, it can be computed using only the ECG, which is an advantage when developing wearable systems with limited number of sensors.},

	abstract = {The use of heart rate variability (HRV) in research has been greatly popularized over the past decades due to the ease and affordability of HRV collection, coupled with its clinical relevance and signiﬁcant relationships with psychophysiological constructs and psychopathological disorders. Despite the wide use of electrocardiograms (ECG) in research and advancements in sensor technology, the analytical approach and steps applied to obtain HRV measures can be seen as complex. Thus, this poses a challenge to users who may not have the adequate background knowledge to obtain the HRV indices reliably. To maximize the impact of HRV-related research and its reproducibility, parallel advances in users’ understanding of the indices and the standardization of analysis pipelines in its utility will be crucial. This paper addresses this gap and aims to provide an overview of the most up-to-date and commonly used HRV indices, as well as common research areas in which these indices have proven to be very useful, particularly in psychology. In addition, we also provide a step-by-step guide on how to perform HRV analysis using an integrative neurophysiological toolkit, NeuroKit2.},

Is selection on traits that affect mating success as strong as selection on traits that affect survival? Does selection tend to favor larger body size, and, if so, what are its consequences?

Easy access to measuring HRV has led to a plethora of studies within emotion science and psychology assessing autonomic regulation, but signiﬁcant caveats exist due to the complicated nature of HRV. Firstly, both breathing and blood pressure regulation have their own relationship to social, emotional, and cognitive experiments – if this is the case are we observing heart rate (HR) changes as a consequence of breathing changes? Secondly, experiments often have poor internal and external controls. In this review we highlight the interrelationships between HR and respiration, as well as presenting recommendations for researchers to use when collecting data for HRV assessment. Namely, we highlight the superior utility of within-subjects designs along with the importance of establishing an appropriate baseline and monitoring respiration.},

	abstract = {Ultra-short-term (UST) heart rate variability (HRV) metrics have increasingly been proposed as surrogates for short-term HRV metrics. However, the concurrent validity, within-day reliability, and between-day reliability of UST HRV have yet to be comprehensively documented. Thirty-six adults (18 males, age: 26 ± 5 yr, BMI: 24 ± 3 kg/m2) were recruited. Measures of HRV were quantiﬁed in a quiet-stance upright orthostatic position via three-lead electrocardiogram (ADInstruments, FE232 BioAmp). All short-term data recordings were 300 s in length and ﬁve UST time points (i.e., 30 s, 60 s, 120 s, 180 s, and 240 s) were extracted from the original 300-s recording. Bland–Altman plots with 95\% limits of agreement, repeated measures ANOVA and two-tailed paired t tests demarcated differences between UST and short-term recordings. Linear regressions, coefﬁcient of variation, intraclass correlation coefﬁcients, and other tests examined the validity and reliability in both time- and frequency domains. No group differences were noted between all short-term and UST measures, for either time- (all P {\textgreater} 0.202) or frequency-domain metrics (all P {\textgreater} 0.086). A longer recording duration was associated with augmented validity and reliability, which was less impacted by confounding inﬂuences from physiological variables (e.g., respiration rate, carbon dioxide end-tidals, and blood pressure). Conclusively, heart rate, time-domain, and relative frequency-domain HRV metrics were acceptable with recordings greater or equal to 60 s, 240 s, and 300 s, respectively. Future studies employing UST HRV metrics should thoroughly understand the methodological requirements to obtain accurate results. Moreover, a conservative approach should be utilized regarding the minimum acceptable recording duration, which ensures valid/reliable HRV estimates are obtained.},

	abstract = {Healthy biological systems exhibit complex patterns of variability that can be described by mathematical chaos. Heart rate variability (HRV) consists of changes in the time intervals between consecutive heartbeats called interbeat intervals (IBIs). A healthy heart is not a metronome. The oscillations of a healthy heart are complex and constantly changing, which allow the cardiovascular system to rapidly adjust to sudden physical and psychological challenges to homeostasis. This article brieﬂy reviews current perspectives on the mechanisms that generate 24 h, short-term ({\textasciitilde}5 min), and ultra-short-term ({\textless}5 min) HRV, the importance of HRV, and its implications for health and performance. The authors provide an overview of widely-used HRV time-domain, frequency-domain, and non-linear metrics. Time-domain indices quantify the amount of HRV observed during monitoring periods that may range from {\textasciitilde}2 min to 24 h. Frequency-domain values calculate the absolute or relative amount of signal energy within component bands. Non-linear measurements quantify the unpredictability and complexity of a series of IBIs. The authors survey published normative values for clinical, healthy, and optimal performance populations. They stress the importance of measurement context, including recording period length, subject age, and sex, on baseline HRV values. They caution that 24 h, short-term, and ultra-short-term normative values are not interchangeable. They encourage professionals to supplement published norms with ﬁndings from their own specialized populations. Finally, the authors provide an overview of HRV assessment strategies for clinical and optimal performance interventions.},

Methods: 29 healthy subjects were measured at rest during 5 min of guided breathing and normal breathing using smartphone PPG, a heart-rate chest strap, and electrocardiography (ECG). The root mean sum of the squared differences between R–R intervals (rMSSD) was determined from each device. Results: Compared to ECG, the technical error of estimate (TEE) was acceptable for all conditions (average TEE CV\% [90\% CI] = 6.35 [5.13; 8.5]). When assessed as a standardized difference, all differences were deemed “trivial” (average standard difference [90\% CI] = 0.10 [0.08; 0.13]). Both PPG- and heart-rate-sensor-derived measures had almost perfect correlations with ECG (R = 1.00 [0.99; 1.00]). Conclusion: Both PPG and heart-rate sensors provide an acceptable agreement for the measurement of rMSSD when compared with ECG. Smartphone PPG technology may be a preferred method of HRV data collection for athletes due to its practicality and ease of use in the ﬁeld.},

Our hypothesis was that there would be a significant difference between test performance and HRV parameters, and the high performing group would have significantly higher HRV parameters than the low performing group. Fifty-three healthy men (Mage=26.9±4 years, Mheight=177.9±5.7 cm; Mweight=77.8±8.7 kg) were recruited in the current study. We completed the data collection procedure for each participant in four consecutive days. On day-1, anthropometric measurements were conducted and then participants performed isokinetic tests. On day-2, participants performed anaerobic tests; on day-3 equilibrium tests, and on day-4 aerobic capacity tests. The HRV records of all participants were obtained before, during and after all these tests. Based on the participants’ performance, they were classified into two groups: participants in G1 had lower performance and those in G2 higher performance. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA yielded significant differences in HRV values obtained in the four different tests. There was a significant difference between fitness test performance groups in the variation of short- and ultra-short-term HRV parameters.},

	abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV) is a relevant marker reflecting cardiac modulation by sympathetic and vagal components of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Although the clinical application of HRV is mainly associated with the prediction of sudden cardiac death and assessing cardio­ vascular and metabolic illness progression, recent observations have suggested its applicability to physical exercise training. HRV is becoming one of the most useful tools for tracking the time course of training adaptation/maladaptation of athletes and in setting the optimal training loads leading to improved performances. However, little is known regarding the role of HRV and the internal effects of physical exercise on an athlete, which may be useful in designing fitness programs ensuring sufficient training load that may correspond with the specific ability of the athlete. In this review, we offer a comprehensive assessment of investigations concerning the interrelation between HRV and ANS, and examine how the application of HRV to physical exercise may play a role in sports physiology.},

	abstract = {Cardiac parasympathetic activity may be non-invasively investigated using heart rate variability (HRV), although HRV is not widely accepted to reﬂect sympathetic activity. Instead, cardiac sympathetic activity may be investigated using systolic time intervals (STI), such as the pre-ejection period. Although these autonomic indices are typically measured during rest, the “reactivity hypothesis” suggests that investigating responses to a stressor (e.g., exercise) may be a valuable monitoring approach in clinical and high-performance settings. However, when interpreting these indices it is important to consider how the exercise dose itself (i.e., intensity, duration, and modality) may inﬂuence the response. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to review the literature regarding how the exercise dosage inﬂuences these autonomic indices during exercise and acute post-exercise recovery. There are substantial methodological variations throughout the literature regarding HRV responses to exercise, in terms of exercise protocols and HRV analysis techniques. Exercise intensity is the primary factor inﬂuencing HRV, with a greater intensity eliciting a lower HRV during exercise up to moderate-high intensity, with minimal change observed as intensity is increased further. Post-exercise, a greater preceding intensity is associated with a slower HRV recovery, although the dose-response remains unclear. A longer exercise duration has been reported to elicit a lower HRV only during low-moderate intensity and when accompanied by cardiovascular drift, while a small number of studies have reported conﬂicting results regarding whether a longer duration delays HRV recovery. “Modality” has been deﬁned multiple ways, with limited evidence suggesting exercise of a greater muscle mass and/or energy expenditure may delay HRV recovery. STI responses during exercise and recovery have seldom been reported, although limited data suggests that intensity is a key determining factor. Concurrent monitoring of HRV and STI may be a valuable noninvasive approach to investigate autonomic stress reactivity; however, this integrative approach has not yet been applied with regards to exercise stressors.},

	abstract = {In mobile healthcare, heart rate variability (HRV) is increasingly being used in dynamic patient states. In this situation, shortening of the measurement time is required. This study aimed to validate ultra-short-term HRV in non-static conditions. We conducted electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements at rest, during exercise, and in the postexercise recovery period in 30 subjects and analyzed ultra-short-term HRV in time and frequency domains by ECG in 10, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240-s intervals, and compared the values to the 5-min HRV. For statistical analysis, null hypothesis testing, Cohen’s d statistics, Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient, and Bland-Altman analysis were used, with a statistical signiﬁcance level of P {\textless} 0.05. The feasibility of ultra-short-term HRV and the minimum time required for analysis showed differences in each condition and for each analysis method. If the strict criteria satisfying all the statistical methods were followed, the ultra-short-term HRV could be derived from a from 30 to 240-s length of ECG. However, at least 120 s was required in the post-exercise recovery or exercise conditions, and even ultra-short-term HRV was not measurable in some variables. In contrast, according to the lenient criteria needed to satisfy only one of the statistical criteria, the minimum time required for ultra-short-term HRV analysis was 10–60 s in the resting condition, 10–180 s in the exercise condition, and 10–120 s in the postexercise recovery condition. In conclusion, the results of this study showed that a longer measurement time was required for ultra-short-term HRV analysis in dynamic conditions. This suggests that the existing ultra-short-term HRV research results derived from the static condition cannot applied to the non-static conditions of daily life and that a criterion speciﬁc to the non-static conditions are necessary.},

	abstract = {International Journal of Exercise Science 12(2): 9-14, 2019. The purpose of this study was to examine heart rate variability (HRV) at rest, and during submaximal (100 bpm) and maximal exercise in collegiate distance runners. We predicted there would be less HRV during exercise. Eight collegiate runners (19-22 yrs) were recruited for participation. The participants were equipped with a standard Lead II EKG to record HRV at rest. The participants then performed an incremental VO2max test while running on a treadmill. EKG was recorded throughout the exercise test and HRV was later calculated during the submaximal and maximal exercise. To assess HRV the standard deviation of R-R intervals (SDNN) was calculated at rest and during submaximal and maximal exercise. A one-way ANOVA was used to determine HRV differences between these three states. The average R-R interval was 0.961 ± 0.155 s (64 bpm), 0.413 ± 0.018 s (146 bpm), and 0.321 ± 0.008 s (187 bpm) for rest, submaximal, and maximal exercise, respectively. There were significant differences in SDNN from rest to submaximal (0.108 ± 0.055 to 0.008 ± 0.002 s, p {\textless} 0.05), and from rest to maximal exercise (0.108 ± 0.055 to 0.006 ± 0.002 s, p {\textless} 0.05). When comparing HRV between the resting and exercise states it seems that the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) influence at rest contributes to greater HRV, whereas the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) influence during both submaximal and maximal exercise corresponds to a reduced HRV. These effects may be related to the enhanced automaticity effects of norepinephrine acting on its B1 receptor sites in the heart.},

	abstract = {Experimental designs involving repeated measurements on experimental units are widely used in physiological research. Often, relatively many consecutive observations on each experimental unit are involved and the data may be quite nonlinear. Yet evidently, one of the most commonly used statistical methods for dealing with such data sets in physiological research is the repeated-measurements ANOVA model. The problem herewith is that it is not well suited for data sets with many consecutive measurements; it does not deal with nonlinear features of the data, and the interpretability of the model may be low. The use of inappropriate statistical models increases the likelihood of drawing wrong conclusions. The aim of this article is to illustrate, for a reasonably typical repeated-measurements data set, how fundamental assumptions of the repeated-measurements ANOVA model are inappropriate and how researchers may benefit from adopting different modeling approaches using a variety of different kinds of models. We emphasize intuitive ideas rather than mathematical rigor. We illustrate how such models represent alternatives that 1) can have much higher interpretability, 2) are more likely to meet underlying assumptions, 3) provide better fitted models, and 4) are readily implemented in widely distributed software products.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an agent-based model of the labor market. It simulates the market in the recent period at the aggregate level and at the level of the principal categories of labor, on the basis of the decisions of heterogeneous agents, ﬁrms and individuals, who interact. These decisions rely on individual computations of proﬁts and utilities, although rationality is bounded in such a complex environment. The theoretical structure that underlies the decisions is the search concept. We apply this framework to the case of France in 2011. The model is at a scale of 1/4700. It is fairly detailed on the institutions of the labor market that constrain the agents’ decisions. Finally it is calibrated by a powerful algorithm to reproduce a large number of variables of interest. The calibrated model presents a consistent accounting system of the gross ﬂows of the individuals between the main states, employment, distinguishing open ended contracts and ﬁxed duration contracts, unemployment and inactivity. The simulation of the gross ﬂows accounts enables us to analyze the patterns of mobility in a way that the observed statistics on gross ﬂows, which are partial, cannot do. The model then characterizes the nature of the labor market under study, reproducing the high proportion of the ﬁxed duration contracts in the hiring ﬂows, and it points to a dualism of the French labor market.},

In the last decade, thanks to the increase in the computational power, the development of more sophisticated and realistic models has gained attention in cancer research. These computational models can advance our fundamental understandings of the complicated processes involved in metastasis, as a challenging stage for cancer treatment, and can provide new means for developing novel tools for predicting cancer progression. Considering the potential of these models and the plethora of recent computational models of different steps of the metastasis process, this timely review provides an up-to-date outlook of novel approaches, identifies research gaps and suggests future research directions. This review focuses on physics-based approaches for modeling metastasis process and covers recent computational models and frameworks related to all steps of metastasis from primary tumor growth to secondary tumor formation. In this review, computational models and simulations are classified based on their targeted step of metastasis. Tumor growth and tumor-induced angiogenesis together are considered as a necessary primary step for the metastasis cascade that has four steps: the intravasation of an individual tumor cell into circulatory system, circulation of the cell, arrest and extravasation, and eventually colonization and formation of a metastatic tumor.},

	abstract = {\&lt;p\&gt;The goal of environmental exposure modelling is to link fundamental human activities with stress via the environment. Stress is here defined as environmental conditions negatively affecting human health and well-being. Especially in urban areas, humans can be exposed to multiple stressors such as air pollution, noise (e.g. traffic), and heat. The importance of being able to predict the exposure level in urban areas is increasing due to ongoing urbanization and global climate change. For instance, in Germany annual Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions have been reduced by 28\% from 1990 to 2014 but contributions by the transport sector have been quite stable (from 0.163 GtCO2Equivalents in 1990 to 0.160 GtCO2Equivalents in 2014 (Umweltbundesamt, 2016). Yang et al. (2018) provides a stylized agent-based model of human exposure to environmental stressors (heat, rain, NO2) for Hamburg, Germany. Within this ABM, the changing exposure to environmental stressors is analyzed for citizens as a function of time and location. The population is classified into different archetypes; they range from young, single students to families with children to old, rich and single persons. While their choice of transportation is a function of exposure, commuting time and costs, each agent has different preferences and different rates to adapt to changing environmental conditions. The agents are moving in multiple layers of housing (e.g. residential buildings) and infrastructure (e.g. streets, subway). Depending on the agent types, bike, car or public transport is chosen as the preferred mean of transport. However, Yang et al. (2018) consider stylized agent-based dynamics without any interaction among the agents. We provide a multi-agent docking study of human exposure to environmental stressors implemented in Netlogo and find distributional and relational equivalence (Axtell et al., 1996, Hokamp et al. 2018) to Yang et al. (2018). To put it differently, we analyze interacting individual heterogeneous agents in an actual urban environment. Results give information about the mean of transportation with the lowest exposure and how very low costs for public transport affect choices of transportation and so the road traffic. Further, the results may be used by policy makers and citizens (e.g. via mobile devices using an app) to improve environmental quality of life.\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;\&lt;br\&gt;References\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;Axtell, R., Axelrod, R., Epstein, J.M., and Cohen, M.D. (1996) Aligning simulation models: a case study and results.

	abstract = {Theoretical labour market models that incorporate social networks have largely focused on the steady-state of the system, ignoring their short- and medium-term dynamic effects. In many agent-based models of job search, the unemployed were either static, taking any vacancy proposed to them, or chose among vacancies based on either proposed wage or whether there were any of their friends employed in the firm. Thus, job satisfaction, an important multi-faceted concept in the labour market literature, has been overlooked. We propose a way to measure job satisfaction and illustrate how it can be incorporated in an agent-based model of the labour market. We use a simulation to study the dynamics of this model.},

	abstract = {Mountain communities in developing and transitioning countries are experiencing a period of rapid social, economic, and environmental change. While change has long been a feature of mountain life, the rate, magni­ tude, nature, and number of the transformations now taking place is unprecedented, with profound implications for the sustainability and welfare of mountain communities in the coming years. It is therefore vital that their potential impacts be understood. Considering stressors in isolation can give a false picture as each stressor alters the context within which the other stressors are operating. Holistic approaches are needed. In this paper, a variety of stressors are concurrently simulated within an empirically informed agent-based model of a rural Nepalese mountain community so that their combined impact can be studied. The potential effect of changing fertility rates, increasing crop yield variability, and earthquakes on household finances is considered for the period 2015–2030. Results show that higher fertility rates, increased crop yield variability, and earthquakes all have negative long-term effects on household finances, and that each of these stressors compounds the effect of the other stressors in an additive fashion. Results further highlight heterogeneity in the capacity of households to cope with stressors and demonstrate the important role that happenstance can play in exacerbating the effect of stressors. Our findings suggest that development practitioners should explicitly take multiple stressors into ac­ count when considering interventions. They should also contemplate improved microtargeting of households to increase aid effectiveness over the longer term, while recognising that household vulnerability is often dynamic.},

	abstract = {Subcontracting represents a popular business model in supply chains across industries. In the case of hidden subcontracting, subcontractors are beyond the visible horizon of the (focal) buying firm. Hence, buyers must rely on a cascading effect for diffusing practices such as compliance with labor standards through their supply networks. Motivated by the case of the Bangladeshi garment industry, we constructed an agent-based model with buyers, first-tier suppliers, and subcontractors as agents in a supply network in order to study the impact of network characteristics on the diffusion of labor standards. Our model followed a power-based diffusion rule that emphasized the coercive power that buyers use to pressure their suppliers into adopting labor standards. This rule is a key underlying assumption of compliance-based supplier management. Hypotheses regarding power asymmetries through centrality and density of specific network components, as well as structural elements of the network, such as complexity and distance, were tested for different industry scenarios. Our analysis demonstrated that network asymmetries have ample negative effects on the adoption of labor standards, whereas complexity plays a minor role. Moreover, the impact of the tested structural determinants for sustainability diffusion was found to be contingent on specific industry types in the garment industry. This paper discusses its findings in light of previous research on subcontracting and multitier supply chain management. Among others, we highlight how subcontracting increases horizontal complexity at each supply chain tier, and how intermediaries such as sustainability nexus suppliers may crucially affect the adoption of labor standards within industries.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the e ects of di erent characteristics of apprenticeship programmes both in historical and contemporary societies. Apprenticeship is one of the major means to transfer skills in a society. We consider five societies: the old Britain system (AD 1300s−1600s), the British East India Company (AD 1600s − 1800s), Armenian merchants of New-Julfa (AD 1600s − 1700s), contemporary German apprenticeship (1990s), and the “Modern Apprenticeship” in Britain (2001). In comparing these systems, using an agent-based simulation model, we identified six characteristics which impact the success of an apprenticeship programme in a society, which we measured by considering three parameters, namely the number of skilled agents produced by the apprenticeships, programme completion, and the contribution of programmes to the Gross Domestic Income (GDI) of the society. We investigate di erent definitions for success of an apprenticeship and some hypothetical societies to test some common beliefs about apprenticeships’ performance. The simulations suggest that a) it is better to invest in a public educational system rather than subsidising private contractors to train apprentices, b) having a higher completion ratio for apprenticeship programme does not necessarily result in a higher contribution in the GDI, and c) governors (e.g. mayors or government) that face significant emigration should also consider employing policies that persuade apprentices to complete their programme and stay in the society a er completion to improve apprenticeship e icacy.},

However, the rationale for choosing a particular human decision model is often not sufﬁciently empirically or theoretically substantiated in the model documentation. Furthermore, it is difﬁcult to compare models because the model descriptions are often incomplete, not transparent and difﬁcult to understand. Therefore, we expand and reﬁne the ‘ODD’ (Overview, Design Concepts and Details) protocol to establish a standard for describing ABMs that includes human decision-making (ODD þ D). Because the ODD protocol originates mainly from an ecological perspective, some adaptations are necessary to better capture human decision-making. We extended and rearranged the design concepts and related guiding questions to differentiate and describe decision-making, adaptation and learning of the agents in a comprehensive and clearly structured way. The ODD þ D protocol also incorporates a section on ‘Theoretical and Empirical Background’ to encourage model designs and model assumptions that are more closely related to theory. The application of the ODD þ D protocol is illustrated with a description of a socialeecological ABM on water use. Although the ODD þ D protocol was developed on the basis of example implementations within the socio-ecological scientiﬁc community, we believe that the ODD þ D protocol may prove helpful for describing ABMs in general when human decisions are included.},

The institutions supporting CSS in the academy have also grown substantially, as evidenced by the proliferation of conferences, workshops, and summer schools across the globe, across disciplines, and across sources of data.

	abstract = {▪ Abstract  Sociologists often model social processes as interactions among variables. We review an alternative approach that models social life as interactions among adaptive agents who influence one another in response to the influence they receive. These agent-based models (ABMs) show how simple and predictable local interactions can generate familiar but enigmatic global patterns, such as the diffusion of information, emergence of norms, coordination of conventions, or participation in collective action. Emergent social patterns can also appear unexpectedly and then just as dramatically transform or disappear, as happens in revolutions, market crashes, fads, and feeding frenzies. ABMs provide theoretical leverage where the global patterns of interest are more than the aggregation of individual attributes, but at the same time, the emergent pattern cannot be understood without a bottom up dynamical model of the microfoundations at the relational level. We begin with a brief historical sketch of the shift from “factors” to “actors” in computational sociology that shows how agent-based modeling differs fundamentally from earlier sociological uses of computer simulation. We then review recent contributions focused on the emergence of social structure and social order out of local interaction. Although sociology has lagged behind other social sciences in appreciating this new methodology, a distinctive sociological contribution is evident in the papers we review. First, theoretical interest focuses on dynamic social networks that shape and are shaped by agent interaction. Second, ABMs are used to perform virtual experiments that test macrosociological theories by manipulating structural factors like network topology, social stratification, or spatial mobility. We conclude our review with a series of recommendations for realizing the rich sociological potential of this approach.},

Model replication remains rare, yet is vital to assessing the repeatability of existing agent based models. Notably, more work is needed to assess cross platform and language replication, which represent potential sources of variability between model results. An existing, complex agent based model was replicated using two widely used platforms (NetLogo and Repast). When results generated by the models were compared, the ﬁndings differed not only in magnitude but the trends produced by the data, resulting in different conclusions being drawn from each set of model predictions. The variation between the models is believed to be a result of the complexity of encoding a substantial theoretical model in particular programming languages. This highlights the express need to document replication of existing models in order to fully understand the potential limitations to replication.},

Taking the Spanish agricultural sector—speciﬁcally the area of Campo de Dal´ıas in Almer´ıa where much of Europe’s vegetables are grown—as a case, we ﬁnd that labour exploitation ﬂourishes in communities of like-minded companies that do not care about mainstream norms. We conﬁrm which socio-economic aspects of labour demand/supply lead to slavery, while challenging the assumption that markets which are dominated by few employers are more prone to exploiting workers. We ﬁnd that, regarding isolation and connectedness of employers, cluster eﬀects and intense inter-employer communication are particularly eﬀective drivers of underpayment if the cluster is homogenous in terms of wage level and if it is isolated from law-abiding employers. This means that employers tend to conﬁrm and reinforce each other in their illegal behaviour, thus creating enclaves in which non-standard norms prevail and worker exploitation is regarded as legitimate. On the other hand, we see that breaking the isolation of employees among each other only increases pay levels if there are law-abiding employers, pointing to the potentially beneﬁcial role social business and entrepreneurs, state-owned companies, or public entrepreneurs could play for transforming labour conditions of entire markets.},

This article presents a dynamic model of institutions, which views them as political game forms that generate the rules of a groupʼs economic interactions. Unlike most prior work, the framework presented here allows for the construction of explicit models of the evolution of institutional rules. It takes account of the fact that group members are likely to try to create rules that benefit themselves. Following from this, it allows us to determine the conditions under which selfinterested individuals will create institutional rules that support cooperation—for example, that prevent a tragedy of the commons. The article finishes with an example of how a model of the evolution of institutional rewards and punishments for promoting cooperation can be created. It is intended that this framework will allow artificial life researchers to examine how human groups can themselves create conditions for cooperation. This will help provide a better understanding of historical human social evolution, and facilitate the resolution of pressing societal social dilemmas.},

Change-making is prominent in this paper, and systems thinking and systems change are prioritised as core elements of prevention research. We report how the process of developing a theory of systems change can assist prevention research to progress from understanding systems, towards impactful action within those systems. Based on Foster-Fishman and Watson’s ABLe change framework, a Prevention Systems Change Framework (PSCF) was adapted and applied to an Australian case study of the drivers of healthy and equitable eating as a structured reﬂective practice. The PSCF comprises four components: building a systemic lens on prevention, holding a continual implementation focus, integrating the systemic lens and implementation focus, and developing a theory of change. Application of the framework as part of a systemic evaluation process enabled a detailed and critical assessment of the healthy and equitable eating project goals and culminated in the development of a theory of prevention systems change speciﬁc to that project, to guide future research and action. Arguably, if prevention research is to support improved health outcomes, it must be more explicitly linked to creating systems change.},

Understanding these system dynamics can support decision making for the pandemic response and recovery measures. This study combined a scoping review with a causal loop diagram to further understanding of the connections between SDH, pandemic measures, and both short- and long-term outcomes in New Zealand. The causal loop diagram showed the reinforcing nature of structural SDH, such as colonization and socio-economic inﬂuences, on health inequities. While balancing actions taken by government eliminated COVID-19, the diagram showed that existing structural SDH inequities could increase health inequities in the longer term, unless the opportunity is taken for socio-economic policies to be reset. Such policy resets would be difﬁcult to implement, as they are at odds with the current socio-economic system. The causal loop diagram highlighted that SDH signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced the dynamics of the COVID-19 impact and response, pointing to a need for purposeful systemic action to disrupt the reinforcing loops which increase health inequities over time. This will require strong systems leadership, and coordination between policy makers and implementation at local level.},

	abstract = {Psychosocial constructs can only be assessed indirectly, and measures are typically formed by a combination of indicators that are thought to relate to the construct. Reflective and formative measurement models offer different conceptualizations of the relation between the indicators and what is sometimes conceived of as a univariate latent variable supposed to correspond in some way to the construct. I argue that the empirical implications of reflective and formative models will often be violated by data since the causally relevant constituents will generally be multivariate, not univariate. These empirical implications can be formally tested but factor analysis is not adequate to do so. I argue that formative models misconstrue the relation between the constructed measures and the underlying reality by which causal processes operate, but that reflective models misconstrue the nature of the underlying reality itself by typically presuming that the constituents of it that are causally efficacious are unidimensional. I discuss the ensuing problems arising from these misconstruals. I propose a causal interpretation of associations between constructed measures and various outcomes that is applicable to both reflective and formative models and is applicable even if the usual assumptions of these models are violated. I put forward an outline for a new model of the process of measure construction and discuss the practical implications of these observations and proposals for the provision of definitions, the selection of items, item-by-item analyses, the construction of measures, and the interpretation of the associations of these measures with subsequent outcomes.},

The potential outcomes framework, as articulated by Rubin, makes an assumption of no multiple versions of treatment, and here we discuss an extension of this potential outcomes framework to accommodate causal inference under violations of this assumption. A variety of examples are discussed in which the assumption may be violated. Identification results are provided for the overall treatment effect and the effect of treatment on the treated when multiple versions of treatment are present and also for the causal effect comparing a version of one treatment to some other version of the same or a different treatment. Further identification and interpretative results are given for cases in which the version precedes the treatment as when an underlying treatment variable is coarsened or dichotomized to create a new treatment variable for which there are effectively “multiple versions”. Results are also given for effects defined by setting the version of treatment to a prespecified distribution. Some of the identification results bear resemblance to identification results in the literature on direct and indirect effects. We describe some settings in which ignoring multiple versions of treatment, even when present, will not lead to incorrect inferences.},

After reviewing psychosocial phenomena that cannot be predicted by the “conventional” class structure, the author introduces a new definition of production output value (New Value), more closely related to psychosocial well-being. A psychosocial class structure model is presented based on nine occupational subgroups in four status levels, representing both conventional and New Value-based status differences. An empirical analysis of 38 occupations in the U.S. work force (U.S. Quality of Employment Surveys 1969, 1972, 1977) uses psychosocial job dimensions of decision latitude, psychological demands, physical exertion, and social support. The author reviews job redesign strategies for three New Value “impoverished” groups with routinized, bureaucratized, and commercialized jobs, and the conditions for economic stability and political participation related to the psychosocial class structure model. Conflicts arising between conventional and New Value-based policies are discussed.},

	abstract = {Objectives This study attempted to determine whether an ecological association exists between job strain and common mental disorders at the occupational level and whether the association is a confounding effect of socioeconomic status.
Methods Male occupations from Belgium (N=184) and the United States (US) (N=120) were chosen from the BELSTRESS study (Belgian job-stress study) (1994–1998) and quality of employment surveys (1972–1977), respectively. Age, marital status, socioeconomic indicators, job control (skill discretion and decision authority), psychological demands, supervisory and coworker supports, physical demands, job insecurity, and symptom scales for mental disorders were all aggregated at the occupational level (detailed occupational codes). Job strain was defined as a ratio of psychological demands to job control. Simple correlations, graphic investigations, and multivariate regression analyses were conducted.
Results While job strain was significantly correlated with socioeconomic indicators in the US sample, their covariance was less than 30\% in both samples. In the graphic investigations, job strain was orthogonal to all of the socioeconomic indicators. Job strain (both samples), job control (US sample), skill discretion (Belgian sample), and psychological demands (Belgian sample) were associated with mental disorders, after control for the covariates (including socioeconomic indicators). The association of decision authority with mental disorders was relatively weak in both samples. Generally, the associations were stronger in the low or middle socioeconomic group than in the high socioeconomic group.
Conclusions Job strain is associated with common mental disorders at the occupational level, and it is not explained fully in the context of the association between socioeconomic status and mental disorders.},

We agree with those who have argued for the wider adoption of agent-based modelling (ABM) in taking on these challenges. However, while ABM has been used occasionally in population health, we argue that for ABM to be most effective in the field it should be used as a means for answering questions normally inaccessible to the traditional epidemiological toolkit. In an effort to clearly illustrate the utility of ABM for population health research, and to clear up persistent misunderstandings regarding the method’s conceptual underpinnings, we offer a detailed presentation of the core concepts of complex systems theory, and summarise why simulations are essential to the study of complex systems. We then examine the current state of the art in ABM for population health, and propose they are well-suited for the study of the ‘wicked’ problems in population health, and could make significant contributions to theory and intervention development in these areas.},

In the Netherlands, a few initiatives during the 1980s and early 1990s looked promising, in particular, as these initiatives focused on work quality as one major precondition for reducing disability and enhancing labor participation. Prospects are less bright today. Ever larger slices of governmental monetary, financial, economic, and social policies become market oriented, as distinct from conducivity oriented. The instrument of the covenant, nonetheless, may prove worthwhile in further promoting the banner of work quality.},

The game develops “local languages” of worker coordination using visual images of a multiworker skill integration based on “skill plates.” Usage of the game in the companies activated shop-floor workers and companies to engage in self-managed work reorganization activities.},

Instead, the program has mainly targeted organizational development in established companies, accepting the existing principles of wealth creation. The model of conductivity can strength the visions behind the pragmatic approach by its conceptualization of an alternative creation of wealth related to opportunities in current working life: a creation of wealth based on skill, creativity and networking among employees across the borders of the organizations and released from the language of management.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Continuous noninvasive blood pressure (BP) measurement enables us to observe rapid changes in BP and to study underlying hemodynamic mechanisms. This study aimed to gain insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying short-term orthostatic BP recovery patterns in a realworld clinical setting with (pre)syncope patients. Setting and Participants: In a prospective cohort study, the active lying-to-standing test was performed in suspected (pre)syncope patients in the emergency department with continuous noninvasive ﬁnger arterial BP measurement. Measures: Changes in systolic BP, cardiac output (CO), and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) were studied in normal BP recovery, initial orthostatic hypotension, delayed BP recovery, and sustained orthostatic hypotension.
Results: In normal recovery (n ¼ 47), DBP at nadir was À24 (23) mmHg, with a CO change of þ10 (21\%) and SVR of À23 (21\%). In initial orthostatic hypotension (n ¼ 7) DBP at nadir was À49 (17) mmHg and CO and SVR change was À5 (46\%) and À29 (58\%), respectively. Delayed recovery (n ¼ 12) differed signiﬁcantly from normal recovery 30 seconds after standing, with a DBP of À32 (19) vs 1 (16) mmHg, respectively. Delayed recovery was associated with a signiﬁcant difference in SVR changes compared to normal recovery, À17 (26\%) vs þ4 (20\%), respectively. There was no difference in CO changes. In sustained orthostatic hypotension (n ¼ 16), DBP at 180 seconds after standing was À39 (21) mmHg, with changes in CO of À16 (31\%) and SVR of À9 (20\%).
Conclusions/Implications: Hemodynamic patterns following active standing are heterogeneous and differ across orthostatic BP recovery patterns, suggesting that volume status, medication use, and autonomic dysfunction should all be taken into account when evaluating these patients. Moreover, results suggest that a delayed BP recovery is associated with an impaired increase in SVR in a signiﬁcant proportion of individuals, implying that physicians treating older adults with hypertension should consider the possible negative effect of intensive hypertension treatment on initial orthostatic blood pressure control.},

The new definition includes a thermodynamical aspect of life as a far from equilibrium system and considers the flow of information from the environment to the living system. In our derivation of the definition of life we have assumed the hypothesis, that during the emergence of life evolution had to first involve autocatalytic systems that only subsequently acquired the capacity of genetic heredity. The new proposed definition of life is independent of the mode of evolution, regardless of whether Lamarckian or Darwinian evolution operated at the origins of life and throughout evolutionary history. The new definition of life presented herein is formulated in a minimal manner and it is general enough that it does not distinguish between individual (metabolic) network and the collective (ecological) one. The newly proposed definition of life may be of interest for astrobiology, research into the origins of life or for efforts to produce synthetic or artificial life, and it furthermore may also have implications in the cognitive and computer sciences.},

The final, short distance ({\textless} 50 µm) from capillary to the most distant mitochondria, in skeletal muscle where exercising ­O2 demands may increase 100-fold, challenges our understanding of ­O2 transport. To power cellular energetics ­O2 reaches its muscle mitochondrial target by dissociating from hemoglobin, crossing the red cell membrane, plasma, endothelial surface layer, endothelial cell, interstitial space, myocyte sarcolemma and a variable expanse of cytoplasm before traversing the mitochondrial outer/inner membranes and reacting with reduced cytochrome c and protons. This past century our understanding of ­O2’s passage across the body’s final O­ 2 frontier has been completely revised. This review considers the latest structural and functional data, challenging the following entrenched notions: (1) That ­O2 moves freely across blood cell membranes. (2) The Krogh–Erlang model whereby O­ 2 pressure decreases systematically from capillary to mitochondria. (3) Whether intramyocyte diffusion distances matter. (4) That mitochondria are separate organelles rather than coordinated and highly plastic syncytia. (5) The roles of free versus myoglobin-facilitated ­O2 diffusion. (6) That myocytes develop anoxic loci. These questions, and the intriguing notions that (1) cellular membranes, including interconnected mitochondrial membranes, act as low resistance conduits for ­O2, lipids and ­H+-electrochemical transport and (2) that myoglobin oxy/deoxygenation state controls mitochondrial oxidative function via nitric oxide, challenge established tenets of muscle metabolic control. These elements redefine muscle ­O2 transport models essential for the development of effective therapeutic countermeasures to pathological decrements in ­O2 supply and physical performance.},

It broadens the definition of economically valid social activity and it will help to resolve the unemployment dilemma arising with globalization. The article observes that the flexibility demanded by neoliberal, market-oriented policy is antithetical to the flexibility of creative production, which builds on horizontal interaction at work and in exchange, thereby facilitating the creation of social relationships and social capital.

Logistic longitudinal regression analyses of the 5-year cohort of the German Study of Mental Health at Work (S-MGA) 2011/12–2017 of 2212 employees were conducted. The observed combined effect of low job control and high psychological demands on depressive symptoms did not indicate interaction (RERI = −0.26, 95\% CI = −0.91; 0.40). When dichotomizing subscales at the median, differential effects of subscales were not found. When dividing subscales into categories based on value ranges, differential effects for job control subscales (namely, decision authority and skill discretion) were found (p = 0.04). This study does not support all assumptions of the DC model: (1) it corroborates previous studies not ﬁnding an interaction of psychological demands and job control; and (2) signs of differential subscale effects were found regarding job control.

It not only requires a causal understanding of the world but also the ability to distinguish whether a given event is the result of an agent’s own action (intervention) or simply the consequence of the world being in action (observation). Previous studies have shown that humans can learn causal structures, and that they can distinguish interventions from observations. These studies almost exclusively focused on structures where interventions led to a simple forward conditioned inference problem. We tested human subjects in a prediction game that required the integration over hidden causes, using a betting mechanism that allowed us to monitor subjects’ beliefs. Subjects learned the causal structure and the conditional probabilities with appropriate feedback. Once learned, all but one were immediately able to correctly predict the causal effects of their interventions according to optimal causal reasoning.},

For such games, we study belief updating in a class of strategic games in which any player’s action causes some consequence via a causal model, which is unknown by all players; for this reason, the most suitable model is Harsanyi’s Bayesian Game. We propose a probability updating for the Bayesian Game in such a way that the knowledge of any player in terms of probabilistic beliefs about the causal model, as well as what is caused by her actions as well as the actions of every other player are taken into account. Based on such probability updating we deﬁne a Nash equilibria for Causal Games.},

	abstract = {This paper outlines the model-based theory of causal reasoning. It postulates that the core meanings of causal assertions are deterministic and refer to temporally-ordered sets of possibilities: A causes B to occur means that given A, B occurs, whereas A enables B to occur means that given A, it is possible for B to occur. The paper shows how mental models represent such assertions, and how these models underlie deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning yielding explanations. It reviews evidence both to corroborate the theory and to account for phenomena sometimes taken to be incompatible with it. Finally, it reviews neuroscience evidence indicating that mental models for causal inference are implemented within lateral prefrontal cortex.},

Based on this assumption we conducted an experiment, showing that subjects’ confidence in causal predictions decreased if their causal knowledge is discredited. Moreover, confidence decreased not only for the causal knowledge that was discredited, but also for knowledge that was not at all manipulated. Additional to the experimental results, we present an ACT-R model that perfectly fits the data and provides an explanation for the empirical findings. Contextual change turns out to sufficiently explain the empirical data and the principle of our ACT-R model.},

	abstract = {This paper reports an experiment that investigated the influence of causal interpretation on acquisition and use of two knowledge types about a static system: I-O knowledge (instances of system states) and structural knowledge (knowledge about causal relations within the system). One group of subjects saw system states without being informed about the causal nature of the material. Another group saw the same states as switches and lamps. It is assumed that the group without causal interpretation can only acquire I-O knowledge. If I-O knowledge is the predominant type when dealing with small systems, then there should be no group differences in a recognition task. Actually, the group with causal interpretation discriminates much better between targets and distractors, but with longer RTs. This is interpreted in terms of structural knowledge acquired by the group with causal interpretation, which was used to reconstruct system states in cases of doubt. Results of a task where subjects had to judge single causal relations support that interpretation, but also indicate that the knowledge about effects is probably not represented in an explicit, symbolic form. An ACT-R model that uses associations between events as a subsymbolic form of structural knowledge reproduces the data well. Thus, data and model support the significance of I-O knowledge but also shed some light on the role and the development of structural knowledge.},

Background:  A compilation of evidence on the causal relationship between RFs and WRMSDs among professional drivers is lacking.
Methods:  A systematic search of the literature was conducted in major electronic data bases that include Medline (1946 + via OvidSP), Embase (1974 + OvidSP), CINAHL (1982+), AMED, and Web of Science. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed and scored. A descriptive analysis on the categories of RFs associated with WRMSDs was conducted. The Bradford–Hill causation criteria and evidence interpretation tool were used to evaluate the causal relationship between RFs and WRMSDs in professional drivers.
Results:  Among the 54 studies reviewed, a strong evidence suggests a causal relationship between RFs such as whole-­body vibration, awkward postures, lifting tasks, manual material handling, job stress, job demand, and previous pain episodes with WRMSDs. Moderate evidence was observed on RFs such as uncomfortable seat and low job satisfaction. The evidence on causal relationship between RFs such as years of professional driving, driving duration, and individual characteristics such as age and body mass index was inconclusive.
Conclusion:  There is strong to moderate evidence on the causal relationship between the physical and psychosocial RFs and WRMSDs among professional drivers.},

@article{bernstein_impedance_2010,
	title = {Impedance cardiography: {Pulsatile} blood flow and the biophysical and electrodynamic basis for the stroke volume equations},
	abstract = {Impedance cardiography (ICG) is a branch of bioimpedance primarily concerned with the determination of left ventricular stroke volume (SV). As implemented, using the transthoracic approach, the technique involves applying a current field longitudinally across a segment of thorax by means of a constant magnitude, high frequency, low amplitude alternating current (AC). By Ohm’s Law, the voltage difference measured within the current field is proportional to the electrical impedance Z (Ω). Without ventilatory or cardiac activity, Z is known as the transthoracic, static base impedance Z0. Upon ventricular ejection, a characteristic time dependent cardiac-synchronous pulsatile impedance change is obtained, ∆Z(t), which, when placed electrically in parallel with Z0, constitutes the time-variable total transthoracic impedance Z(t). ∆Z(t) represents a dual-element composite waveform, which comprises both the radially-oriented volumetric expansion of and axially-directed forward blood flow within both great thoracic arteries. In its majority, however, ∆Z(t) is known to primarily emanate from the ascending aorta. Conceptually, commonly implemented methods assume a volumetric origin for the peak systolic upslope of ∆Z(t), (i.e. dZ/dtmax), with the presumed units of Ω·s–1. A recently introduced method assumes the rapid ejection of forward flowing blood in earliest systole causes significant changes in the velocity-induced blood resistivity variation (∆ρb(t), Ωcm·s–1), and it is the peak rate of change of the blood resistivity variation dρb(t)/dtmax (Ωcm·s–2) that is the origin of dZ/dtmax. As a consequence of dZ/dtmax peaking in the time domain of peak aortic blood acceleration, dv/dtmax (cm·s–2), it is suggested that dZ/dtmax is an ohmic mean acceleration analog (Ω·s–2) and not a mean flow or velocity surrogate as generally assumed. As conceptualized, the normalized value, dZ/dtmax/Z0, is a dimensionless ohmic mean acceleration equivalent (s–2), and more precisely, the electrodynamic equivalent of peak aortic reduced average blood acceleration (PARABA, d{\textless}v{\textgreater}/dtmax/R, s–2). As necessary for stroke volume calculation, dZ/dtmax/Z0 must undergo square root transformation to yield an ohmic mean flow velocity equivalent. To compute SV, the square root of the dimensionless ohmic mean acceleration equivalent ([dZ/dtmax/Z0]0.5, s–1) is multiplied by a volume of electrically participating thoracic tissue (VEPT, mL) and left ventricular ejection time (TLVE, s). To find the bulk volume of the thoracic contents (i.e. VEPT), established methods implement exponential functions of measured thoracic length (L(cm)n) or height-based thoracic length equivalents (0.01×\%H(cm)n). The new method conceptualizes VEPT as the intrathoracic blood volume (ITBV, mL), which is approximated through allometric equivalents of body mass (aMb). In contrast to the classical twoelement parallel conduction model, the new method comprises a three-compartment model, which incorporates excess extravascular lung water (EVLW) as a component of both Z0 and VEPT. To fully appreciate the evolution and analytical justification for impedance-derived SV equations, a review of the basics of pulsatile blood flow is in order.},

We describe a whole body computational model for energy conversion during bicycle racing. About 23 per cent of the metabolic energy is used for muscle work, the rest is converted to heat. We calculated heat transfer by conduction and blood flow inside the body, and heat transfer from the skin by radiation, convection and sweat evaporation, resulting in temperature changes in 25 body compartments. We simulated a mountain time trial to Alpe d'Huez during the Tour de France. To approach the time realized by Lance Armstrong in 2004, very high oxygen uptake must be sustained by the simulated cyclist. Temperature was predicted to reach 39
              °
              C in the brain, and 39.7
              °
              C in leg muscle. In addition to the macroscopic simulation, we analysed the buffering of bursts of high adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis by creatine kinase during cyclical muscle activity at the biochemical pathway level. To investigate the low oxygen to carbohydrate ratio for the brain, which takes up lactate during exercise, we calculated the flux distribution in cerebral energy metabolism. Computational modelling of the human body, describing heat exchange and energy metabolism, makes simulation of endurance sports events feasible.},

	abstract = {Ageing and lifespan are strongly affected by metabolism. The maximal possible uptake of oxygen is not only a good predictor of performance in endurance sports, but also of life expectancy. Figuratively speaking, healthy ageing is a competitive sport. Although the root cause of ageing is damage to macromolecules, it is the balance with repair processes that is decisive. Reduced or intermittent nutrition, hormones and intracellular signalling pathways that regulate metabolism have strong effects on ageing. Homeostatic regulatory processes tend to keep the environment of the cells within relatively narrow bounds. On the other hand, the body is constantly adapting to physical activity and food consumption. Spontaneous fluctuations in heart rate and other processes indicate youth and health. A (homeo)dynamic aspect of homeostasis deteriorates with age. We are now in a position to develop computational models of human metabolism and the dynamics of heart rhythm and oxygen transport that will advance our understanding of ageing. Computational modelling of the connections between dietary restriction, metabolism and protein turnover may increase insight into homeostasis of the proteins in our body. In this way, the computational reconstruction of human physiological processes, the Physiome, can help prevent frailty and age-related disease.},

MPC replaces this task with code-generating algorithms that take model code from several different existing models and produce model code for a new JSim model. This is particularly useful during multi-scale model development where many variants are to be configured and tested against data. MPC encodes and preserves information about how a model is built from its simpler model modules, allowing the researcher to quickly substitute or update modules for hypothesis testing.

	abstract = {JSim is a simulation system for developing models, designing experiments, and evaluating hypotheses on physiological and pharmacological systems through the testing of model solutions against data. It is designed for interactive, iterative manipulation of the model code, handling of multiple data sets and parameter sets, and for making comparisons among different models running simultaneously or separately. Interactive use is supported by a large collection of graphical user interfaces for model writing and compilation diagnostics, defining input functions, model runs, selection of algorithms solving ordinary and partial differential equations, run-time multidimensional graphics, parameter optimization (8 methods), sensitivity analysis, and Monte Carlo simulation for defining confidence ranges. JSim uses Mathematical Modeling Language (MML) a declarative syntax specifying algebraic and differential equations. Imperative constructs written in other languages (MATLAB, FORTRAN, C++, etc.) are accessed through procedure calls. MML syntax is simple, basically defining the parameters and variables, then writing the equations in a straightforward, easily read and understood mathematical form. This makes JSim good for teaching modeling as well as for model analysis for research.   For high throughput applications, JSim can be run as a batch job.  JSim can automatically translate models from the repositories for Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) and CellML models. Stochastic modeling is supported. MML supports assigning physical units to constants and variables and automates checking dimensional balance as the first step in verification testing.

	abstract = {Background: Compared to other pulmonary function tests, there is a lack of standardization regarding how a maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) maneuver is performed. Specifically, little is known about the variation in breathing frequency (fR) and its potential impact on the accuracy of test results. This study examines the effect of several preselected values for fR and one self-selected fR (fRself) on MVV.
Methods: Ten participants performed MVV maneuvers at various fR values, ranging from 50 to 130 breaths·min− 1 in 10 breaths·min− 1 intervals and at one fRself. Three identical trials with 2-min rest periods were conducted at each fR, and the sequence in which fR was tested was randomized. Ventilation and related parameters were measured directly by gas exchange analysis via a metabolic measurement system.
Results: A third-order polynomial regression analysis showed that MVV = − 0.0001(fR)3 + 0.0258(fR)2–1.38(fR) + 96.9 at preselected fR and increased up to approximately 100 breaths·min− 1 (r2 = 0.982, P {\textless} 0.001). Paired t-tests indicated that average MVV values obtained at all preselected fR values, but not fRself, were significantly lower than the average maximum value across all participants. A linear regression analysis revealed that tidal volume (VT) = − 2.63(MVV) + 300.4 at preselected fR (r2 = 0.846, P {\textless} 0.001); however, this inverse relationship between VT and MVV did not remain true for the self-selected fR. The VT obtained at this fR (90.9 ± 19.1\% of maximum) was significantly greater than the VT associated with the most similar MVV value (at a preselected fR of 100 breaths·min− 1, 62.0 ± 10.4\% of maximum; 95\% confidence interval of difference: (17.5, 40.4\%), P {\textless} 0.001).
Conclusions: This study demonstrates the shortcomings of the current lack of standardization in MVV testing and establishes data-driven recommendations for optimal fR. The true MVV was obtained with a self-selected fR (mean ± SD: 69.9 ± 22.3 breaths·min− 1) or within a preselected fR range of 110–120 breaths·min− 1. Until a comprehensive reference equation is established, it is advised that MVV be measured directly using these guidelines. If an individual is unable to perform or performs the maneuver poorly at a self-selected fR, ventilating within a mandated fR range of 110–120 breaths·min− 1 may also be acceptable.},

            The American Physical Therapy Association (APTA), in conjunction with the Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Section of APTA, have commissioned the development of this clinical practice guideline to assist physical therapists in their clinical decision making when managing patients with heart failure. Physical therapists treat patients with varying degrees of impairments and limitations in activity and participation associated with heart failure pathology across the continuum of care. This document will guide physical therapist practice in the examination and treatment of patients with a known diagnosis of heart failure. The development of this clinical practice guideline followed a structured process and resulted in 9 key action statements to guide physical therapist practice. The level and quality of available evidence were graded based on specific criteria to determine the strength of each action statement. Clinical algorithms were developed to guide the physical therapist in appropriate clinical decision making. Physical therapists are encouraged to work collaboratively with other members of the health care team in implementing these action statements to improve the activity, participation, and quality of life in individuals with heart failure and reduce the incidence of heart failure-related re-admissions.},

	abstract = {The concept of biological adaptation was closely connected to some mathematical, engineering and physical ideas from the very beginning. Cannon in his “The wisdom of the body” (1932) systematically used the engineering vision of regulation. In 1938, Selye enriched this approach by the notion of adaptation energy. This term causes much debate when one takes it literally, as a physical quantity, i.e. a sort of energy. Selye did not use the language of mathematics systematically, but the formalization of his phenomenological theory in the spirit of thermodynamics was simple and led to veriﬁable predictions. In 1980s, the dynamics of correlation and variance in systems under adaptation to a load of environmental factors were studied and the universal effect in ensembles of systems under a load of similar factors was discovered: in a crisis, as a rule, even before the onset of obvious symptoms of stress, the correlation increases together with variance (and volatility). During 30 years, this effect has been supported by many observations of groups of humans, mice, trees, grassy plants, and on ﬁnancial time series. In the last ten years, these results were supplemented by many new experiments, from gene networks in cardiology and oncology to dynamics of depression and clinical psychotherapy. Several systems of models were developed: the thermodynamic-like theory of adaptation of ensembles and several families of models of individual adaptation. Historically, the ﬁrst group of models was based on Selye’s concept of adaptation energy and used ﬁtness estimates. Two other groups of models are based on the idea of hidden attractor bifurcation and on the advection–diffusion model for distribution of population in the space of physiological attributes. We explore this world of models and experiments, starting with classic works, with particular attention to the results of the last ten years and open questions.},

	abstract = {The heart and lungs are anatomically coupled through the pulmonary circulation and coexist within the sealed thoracic cavity, making the function of these systems highly interdependent. Understanding of the complex mechanical interactions between cardiac and pulmonary systems has evolved over the last century to appreciate that changes in respiratory mechanics significantly impact pulmonary hemodynamics and ventricular filling and ejection. Furthermore, given that the left and right heart share a common septum and are surrounded by the nondistensible pericardium, direct ventricular interaction is an important mediator of both diastolic and systolic performance. Although it is generally considered that cardiopulmonary interaction in healthy individuals at rest minimally affects hemodynamics, the significance during exercise is less clear. Adverse heart-lung interaction in respiratory disease is of growing interest as it may contribute to the pathogenesis of comorbid cardiovascular dysfunction and exercise intolerance in these patients. Similarly, heart failure represents a pathological uncoupling of the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems, whereby cardiac function may be impaired by the normal ventilatory response to exercise. Despite significant research contributions to this complex area, the mechanisms of cardiopulmonary interaction in the intact human and the clinical consequences of adverse interactions in common respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, particularly during exercise, remain incompletely understood. The purpose of this review is to present the key physiological principles of cardiopulmonary interaction as they pertain to resting and exercising hemodynamics in healthy humans and the clinical implications of adverse cardiopulmonary interaction during exercise in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary hypertension, and heart failure.},

	abstract = {The objective of this minireview is to describe the physiology and potential clinical benefits derived from inspiration. Recent animal and clinical studies demonstrate that one of the body’s natural mechanisms associated with inspiration is to harness the respiratory pump to enhance circulation to vital organs. There is evidence that large reductions in intrathoracic pressure ({\textgreater}20 cmH
              2
              O) caused by some inspiration maneuvers (e.g., Mueller maneuver) or pathophysiology (e.g., heart failure, chronic obstructive lung disease) can result in adverse hemodynamic effects. However, the respiratory pump can improve cardiovascular functions when a “sweet spot” for generation of negative intrathoracic pressure during inspiration can be maintained at or less than 10 cmH
              2
              O below normal inspiration. These beneficial physiological effects include greater cardiac filling and output, lower intracranial pressure, cardiac baroreflex resetting, greater cerebral blood flow oscillatory patterns, increased vascular pressure gradients, and promoting sustained feedback between sympathetic nerve activity and arterial pressure. In addition to promoting gas exchange, data obtained from numerous animal and human experiments have provided new insights into “the other side of breathing”: the modulation of circulation by reduced intrathoracic pressure generated during inspiration. The translation of these physiological relationships form the basis for the development and application of technologies designed to optimize the intrathoracic pump for treatment of clinical conditions associated with hypovolemia including cardiac arrest, orthostatic hypotension, hemorrhagic shock, and traumatic brain injury. Harnessing these fundamental mechanisms that control cardiopulmonary physiology provides opportunities to use inspiration as a potential tool to help treat significant and often life-threatening circulatory disorders.},

	abstract = {The intrinsic relationship between ventilation (VE) and carbon dioxide output (VCO2) is described by the modified alveolar ventilation equation VE = VCO2 k/PaCO2(1-VD/VT) where PaCO2 is the partial pressure of CO2 in the arterial blood and VD/VT is the dead space fraction of the tidal volume. Previous investigators have reported that high-intensity exercise uncouples VE from VCO2; however, they did not measure the PaCO2 and VD/VT components of the overall relationship. In an attempt to provide a more complete analysis of the effects of high-intensity exercise on the VE-VCO2 relationship, we undertook an investigation where five subjects volunteered to perform three steady-state tests (SS1, SS2, SS3) at 60 W. One week after SS1 each subject was required to perform repeated 1-min bouts of exercise corresponding to a work rate of approximately 140\% of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). Two and 24 h later the subjects performed SS2 and SS3, respectively. This exercise intervention caused PaCO2 during SS2 and SS3 to be regulated (P less than 0.01) approximately 4 Torr below the control (SS1) value of 38.8 Torr. Additionally, significant alterations were noted for VCO2 with corresponding values of 1.15 (SS1), 1.10 (SS2), and 1.04 (SS3) l/min. No changes were noted in either VD/VT or VE. In summary, it seems reasonable to suggest that the disproportionate increase in VE with respect to VCO2 noted in earlier work does not reflect an uncoupling. Rather the slope of the VE-VCO2 relationship is increased in a predictable manner as described by the modified alveolar ventilation equation.},

From these and steady-state response data, digital computer routines extracted amplitude and phase relations between each variable and the perturbing work load. These response characteristics were well described by first-order linear dynamics with time constants for VE, VCO2, VO2, and HR averaging 1.4, 1.2, 0.8, and 0.8 min, respectively. The time constants of VE and VCO2 were strongly correlated among subjects (r = 0.97). Further, there was no evidence that neural afferents from the exercising limbs induced fast components in the ventilatory response to these forcings. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that exercise hyperpnea is linked to metabolism via carbon dioxide production.},

Analysis indicated a statistically significant change for the total score as well as the deductive and analysis subscales. Post-hoc analysis indicated these differences occurred between times 1 and 2 for the total score as well as both subscales. There was a significant difference between the 2 schools after adjusting for variance in initial test scores. The Midwest school’s mean score (24.85) was greater than the east coast school’s (22.42), and this difference was significant F1 = 12.65; P {\textless} .05. Conclusion. The HSRT was able to detect change in critical thinking scores. This finding, coupled with those of a previous study in which the HSRT was able to detect differences between experts and novices, indicate the HSRT may have validity and therefore may be a useful tool for assessing the critical thinking skills of physical therapist students.},

            In this era of health care accountability, a need exists for a new decision-making and documentation guide in physical therapy. The original Hypothesis-Oriented Algorithm for Clinicians (HOAC) provided clinicians and students with a framework for science-based clinical practice and focused on the remediation of functional deficits and how changes in impairments related to these deficits. The HOAC II was designed to address shortcomings in the original HOAC and be more compatible with contemporary practice, including the Guide to Physical Therapist Practice. Disablement terminology is used in the HOAC II to guide clinicians and students when documenting patient care and incorporating evidence into practice. The HOAC II, like the HOAC, can be applied to a patient regardless of age or disorder and allows for identification of problems by physical therapists when patients are not able to communicate their problems. A feature of the HOAC II that was lacking in the original algorithm is the concept of prevention and how to justify and document interventions directed at prevention.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12889-015-2489-4},
	abstract = {Background: Second-hand smoke (SHS) is the most important contaminant of indoor air in first world countries. The risks associated with SHS exposure are highly relevant, because many people are regularly, and usually involuntarily, exposed to SHS. This study aims to quantify the effects of SHS exposure. Therefore, its impact on ischaemic heart diseases (IHD), chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) and stroke will be considered.
Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify articles dealing with the association between SHS and the three outcomes IHD, COPD and stroke. Overall, 24 articles were included in a meta-analysis using a random effects model. Effect sizes stratified for sex and for both sexes combined were calculated.
Results: The synthesis of primary studies revealed significant effect sizes for the association between SHS exposure and all three outcomes. The highest RR for both sexes combined was found for COPD (RR = 1.66, 95 \% CI: 1.38–2.00). The RR for both sexes combined was 1.35 (95 \% CI: 1.22–1.50) for stroke and 1.27 (95 \% CI: 1.10–1.48) for IHD. The risks were higher in women than in men for all three outcomes.
Conclusions: This is the first study to calculate effect sizes for the association between SHS exposure and the disease outcomes IHD, COPD, and stroke at once. Overall, the effect sizes are comparable with previous findings in meta-analyses and therefore assumed to be reliable. The results indicate the high relevance of public health campaigns and legislation to protect non-smokers from the adverse health effects attributable to SHS exposure.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:The objective of most biomedical research is to determine an unbiased estimate of effect for an exposure on an outcome, i.e. to make causal inferences about the exposure. Recent developments in epidemiology have shown that traditional methods of identifying confounding and adjusting for confounding may be inadequate.

DISCUSSION:The traditional methods of adjusting for "potential confounders" may introduce conditional associations and bias rather than minimize it. Although previous published articles have discussed the role of the causal directed acyclic graph approach (DAGs) with respect to confounding, many clinical problems require complicated DAGs and therefore investigators may continue to use traditional practices because they do not have the tools necessary to properly use the DAG approach. The purpose of this manuscript is to demonstrate a simple 6-step approach to the use of DAGs, and also to explain why the method works from a conceptual point of view.

SUMMARY:Using the simple 6-step DAG approach to confounding and selection bias discussed is likely to reduce the degree of bias for the effect estimate in the chosen statistical model.},

	abstract = {In 1965, Sir Austin Bradford Hill published nine “viewpoints” to help determine if observed epidemiologic associations are causal. Since then, the “Bradford Hill Criteria” have become the most frequently cited framework for causal inference in epidemiologic studies. However, when Hill published his causal guidelines—just 12 years after the doublehelix model for DNA was first suggested and 25 years before the Human Genome Project began—disease causation was understood on a more elementary level than it is today. Advancements in genetics, molecular biology, toxicology, exposure science, and statistics have increased our analytical capabilities for exploring potential cause-and-effect relationships, and have resulted in a greater understanding of the complexity behind human disease onset and progression. These additional tools for causal inference necessitate a re-evaluation of how each Bradford Hill criterion should be interpreted when considering a variety of data types beyond classic epidemiology studies. Herein, we explore the implications of data integration on the interpretation and application of the criteria. Using examples of recently discovered exposure–response associations in human disease, we discuss novel ways by which researchers can apply and interpret the Bradford Hill criteria when considering data gathered using modern molecular techniques, such as epigenetics, biomarkers, mechanistic toxicology, and genotoxicology.},

	abstract = {The biochemical regulation of energy metabolism (EM) allows cells to modulate their energetic output depending on available substrates and requirements. To this end, numerous biomolecular mechanisms exist that allow the sensing of the energetic state and corresponding adjustment of enzymatic reaction rates. This regulation is known to induce dynamic systems properties such as oscillations or perfect adaptation. Although the various mechanisms of energy regulation have been studied in detail from many angles at the experimental and theoretical levels, no framework is available for the systematic analysis of EM from a control systems perspective. In this study, we have used principles well known in control to clarify the basic system features that govern EM. The major result is a subdivision of the biomolecular mechanisms of energy regulation in terms of widely used engineering control mechanisms: proportional, integral, derivative control, and structures: feedback, cascade and feed-forward control. Evidence for each mechanism and structure is demonstrated and the implications for systems properties are shown through simulations. As the equivalence between biological systems and control components presented here is generic, it is also hypothesized that our work could eventually have an applicability that is much wider than the focus of the current study.},

As a consequence, every biochemical reaction in the cytoplasm has an associated proton stoichiometry that is generally noninteger- and pH-dependent. Therefore, with metabolic ﬂux, pH is altered in a medium with ﬁnite buffer capacity. Apparent equilibrium constants and maximum enzyme velocities, which are functions of pH, are also altered. We augmented an earlier mathematical model of skeletal muscle glycogenolysis with pH-dependent enzyme kinetics and reaction equilibria to compute the time course of pH changes. Analysis shows that kinetics and ﬁnal equilibrium states of the closed system are highly constrained by the pH-dependent parameters. This kinetic model of glycogenolysis, coupled to creatine kinase and adenylate kinase, simulated published experiments made with a cell-free enzyme mixture to reconstitute the network and to synthesize PCr and lactate in vitro. Using the enzyme kinetic and thermodynamic data in the literature, the simulations required minimal adjustments of parameters to describe the data. These results show that incorporation of appropriate physical chemistry of the reactions with accurate kinetic modeling gives a reasonable simulation of experimental data and is necessary for a physically correct representation of the metabolic network. The approach is general for modeling metabolic networks beyond the speciﬁc pathway and conditions presented here.},

	abstract = {Water drinking elicits profound pressor responses in patients with impaired baroreflex function and in sinoaortic-denervated mice. Healthy subjects show more subtle changes in heart rate and blood pressure with water drinking. The water-induced pressor response appears to be mediated through sympathetic nervous system activation at the spinal level. Indeed, water drinking raises resting energy expenditure in normal weight and obese subjects. The stimulus setting off the response is hypoosmolarity rather than water temperature or gastrointestinal stretch. Studies in mice suggest that this osmopressor response may involve transient receptor potential vanniloid 4 (Trpv4) receptors. However, the (nerve) cell population serving as peripheral osmosensors and the exact transduction mechanisms are still unknown. The osmopressor response can be exploited in the treatment of orthostatic and postprandial hypotension in patients with severe autonomic failure. Furthermore, the osmopressor response acutely improves orthostatic tolerance in healthy subjects and in patients with neurally mediated syncope. The phenomenon should be recognized as an important confounder in cardiovascular and metabolic studies.},

On the basis of publications and conference presentations, it is clear that the core concepts, conceptual frameworks, and the homeostasis concept inventory have been used by faculty in many ways to improve and assess student learning and align instruction and programs. A growing number of colleagues focus their teaching on physiology core concepts, and some core concepts have been used as explicit themes or organizing principles in physiology or anatomy and physiology textbooks. The core concepts published in 2011 were derived from inputs from a diverse group of physiology instructors and articulated what this group of instructors expressed a decade ago. On the basis of current feedback from the physiology teaching community as a consequence of the use of core concepts in teaching and learning, we have revisited these concepts and made revisions to address issues that have emerged. In this article, we offer revised definitions and explanations of the core concepts, propose an additional core concept (“physical properties of matter” which combines two previous concepts), and describe three broad categories for the revised core concepts. Finally, we catalog published resources for each of the core concepts that provide instructors tools to focus facilitation of student learning on goals (learning outcomes), activities and assessments to enable students to develop and apply their understanding of the core concepts of physiology.},

	abstract = {Study of cardiac functions has shown to be important in understanding the prognosis and pathogenesis of vascular diseases. A physiologic parameter termed pulse transit time (PTT) has been studied intensively to be used as an indirect marker of such pathologic conditions. It is deﬁned as the time it takes a pressure pulsation to travel between two arterial sites. For convenience of measurement, the interval between the peak of the R-wave on the electrocardiogram and the onset of the corresponding pulse in the ﬁnger pad measured by photoplethysmography is usually used. In this review, its deﬁnition, current applications in cardiovascular related studies and issues are presented in turn. Investigational studies suggest that PTT did not meet the level of accuracy required for medical practice as a marker for beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP). However, documented evidences indicate that PTT has high correlations when it is utilised as a surrogate semi-quantitative monitor of abrupt BP changes. Present literature suggests that description of disease-speciﬁc cardiovascular reactivity pattern is possible with techniques based on PTT. The attraction of PTT due to its non-invasive nature and revealing properties can only increase. Hence, the use of this simple technique in a clinical setting is still to realise its full potential.},

Theoretical studies show that using either “mixed” feedback or multiple negative feedback loops with different delays, it is possible to generate complex periodic and aperiodic, chaotic rhythms. In an experimental study of finger tracking using visual feedback, a variable time delay can be added to the feedback circuit. As this delay is varied, complex rhythms of finger displacement are observed. We suggest that the complex dynamics observed in diverse physiological systems in normal individuals may be associated with chaotic dynamics arising from the interaction of multiple feedback loops.},

	abstract = {Organismalperformance lies at the base of ecological and evolutionary processes, and the consequences of individual variation in performance have become afocus of physiological ecology. The study of the relations ofperformance to Darwinian fitness integrates the traditionally reductionist approach ofphysiological ecology with the perspectives ofgenetics and evolution. Four levels of biological organization have been included in this effort:the description ofgenetic variation, the analysis of biochemical andphysiological consequences of that variation, the description of variation in the capacity of individuals toperform various activities, and the analysis of the effect of that variation in performance capacity on individual variation in Darwinian fitness. Mechanisms within each of those levels have been elaborated, and cause-and-effect links have been established among the levels. Two approaches to defining causal links areprominent. Thegene-to-performance school begins with the observation ofgenetic variation (e.g., thepresence in a species of allelic isozymes with different responses to temperature) and seeks to trace theperformance ofdifferent genotypes upward through successive levels of biological organization, ultimately to variation in behavior and the relation of that variation to natural selection. Afew studies have been successful in this endeavor, largely because they were based on detailed information about the ecology of the species investigated. These studies have revealed stabilizing selection maintaining genetic polymorphisms. Physiological ecologists have approached the same questions as those addressed by geneticists, but thephysiologists have started with the description of individual variation in performance that is almost certainly under the control of multiple genetic loci. From thispoint they have moved outward in two directions. One line of investigation involves a reductionist analysis of the mechanistic basis of variation in performance, whereas the other seeks associations between performance and fitness. Substantialprogress has been made in the reductionist direction, although more information is needed about the heritabilities ofparticular characteristics. The upward direction has been less traveled, and the chances of success will be maximized by employing the same detailed ecologicalperspective that has been successfulfor gene-to-performance studies. The activities to be studied should be selected on the basis of their demonstrable importance to thefitness of individuals under natural conditions, and the behavioral ecology literature contains many examples of activities of that sort.},

Stress involves two-way communication between the brain and the cardiovascular, immune, and other systems via neural and endocrine mechanisms. Beyond the “flight-or-fight” response to acute stress, there are events in daily life that produce a type of chronic stress and lead over time to wear and tear on the body (“allostatic load”). Yet, hormones associated with stress protect the body in the short-run and promote adaptation (“allostasis”). The brain is a target of stress, and the hippocampus was the first brain region, besides the hypothalamus, to be recognized as a target of glucocorticoids. Stress and stress hormones produce both adaptive and maladaptive effects on this brain region throughout the life course. Early life events influence life-long patterns of emotionality and stress responsiveness and alter the rate of brain and body aging. The hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex undergo stress-induced structural remodeling, which alters behavioral and physiological responses. As an adjunct to pharmaceutical therapy, social and behavioral interventions such as regular physical activity and social support reduce the chronic stress burden and benefit brain and body health and resilience.},

This concept was originally applied to plant or crop growth (Justus von Liebig, 1840 [1]) and quantitatively supported by many experiments. Some generalizations based on more complicated “doseresponse” curves were proposed. Violations of this law in natural and experimental ecosystems were also reported. We study models of adaptation in ensembles of similar organisms under load of environmental factors and prove that violation of Liebig’s law follows from adaptation eﬀects. If the ﬁtness of an organism in a ﬁxed environment satisﬁes the Law of the Minimum then adaptation equalizes the pressure of essential factors and therefore acts against the Liebig’s law. This is the the Law of the Minimum paradox: if for a randomly chosen pair “organism–environment” the Law of the Minimum typically holds, then, in a well-adapted system, we have to expect violations of this law.},

	abstract = {Objectives The paper presents a new stress physiological theory to describe how low social control can contribute to the development of chronic disease through the deregulation of physiological systems.
Methods Two presumptions and four operating principles are used to derive very generalized forms of hypotheses about disease (and some hypotheses about growth) with respect to the demand–control model. They are based on a new three-part stress model (controller-system-environment) that represents a nested pair of system–environment relations in a systems dynamics formulation, with control limitations based on the Second Law of Thermodynamics, and mechanisms related to an equilibrium of ﬂows of energy and order. The resulting “associationist” demand–control model outlines the processes by which organisms can either devolve into lower levels of complexity equivalent to chronic disease (job strain) or organize themselves into higher levels of complexity (active work).
Results An explanation is provided for how failures of high-level control capacity could be sufﬁcient to explain the development of chronic disease. A new theory of the development of high-level internal control capacity in complex organisms is presented. An “association-of–parts” theoretical format is claimed to be an acceptable alternative to materialistic explanations for both health and growth.
Conclusions The requirements of explaining new effects of complex work and social structures conﬁrm the need to revise the demand–control model into a more general form.},

	abstract = {Background. Evidence suggests that to facilitate physical activity sedentary people may adhere to one component of exercise prescriptions (intensity, duration or frequency) without adhering to other components. Some experts have provided evidence for determinants of adherence to different components among healthy people. However, our understanding remains scarce in this area for patients with neck or low back pain. The aims of this study are to determine whether patients with neck or low back pain have different rates of adherence to exercise components of frequency per week and duration per session when prescribed with a home exercise program, and to identify if adherence to both exercise components have distinct predictive factors. Methods. A cohort of one hundred eighty-four patients with chronic neck or low back pain who attended physiotherapy in eight primary care centers were studied prospectively one month after intervention. The study had three measurement periods: at baseline (measuring characteristics of patients and pain), at the end of physiotherapy intervention (measuring characteristics of the home exercise program) and a month later (measuring professional behaviors during clinical encounters, environmental factors and self-efficacy, and adherence behavior). Results. Adherence to duration per session (70.9\% 7.1) was more probable than adherence to frequency per week (60.7\% 7.0). Self-efficacy was a relevant factor for both exercise components (p {\textless} 0.05). The total number of exercises prescribed was predictive of frequency adherence (p {\textless} 0.05). Professional behaviors have a distinct influence on exercise components. Frequency adherence is more probable if patients received clarification of their doubts (adjusted OR: 4.1; p {\textless} 0.05), and duration adherence is more probable if they are supervised during the learning of exercises (adjusted OR: 3.3; p {\textless} 0.05). Conclusion. We have shown in a clinic-based study that adherence to exercise prescription frequency and duration components have distinct levels and predictive factors. We recommend additional study, and advise that differential attention be given in clinical practice to each exercise component for improving adherence. © 2009 Medina-Mirapeix et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Objective To evaluate the association of heart rate variability with job strain in ﬁrst year resident physicians.
Methods We performed the study at the ‘‘Manuel Gea Gonza´lez’’ General Hospital in Mexico City. 54 resident doctors were studied over a period of 24 hr in their ﬁrst year of specialization. Two questionnaires were administered: the ﬁrst on general demographics, and the second, the Job Content Questionnaire. Heart rate variability was evaluated through the frequency domain (low-frequency power, high-frequency power, and low-frequency power/high-frequency power ratio) and time domain (SDNN). The doctors wore a Holter monitor over a 24-hr period, which included a workday plus their on-call time. They recorded their activities in a log.
Results Compared to physicians in the ‘‘low strain’’ category, physicians working in the ‘‘passive’’ category had lower overall peak-to-peak cardiac variability (standard deviation of N–N intervals, SDNN), À9.08\% (95\% CI À17.97, 0.74), a À25\% (95\% CI À45.00, 0.22) lower high-frequency power, and À26.95\% (95\% CI À39.00, À12.53) lower low-frequency power. Physicians working in the ‘‘high strain’’ category had lower low-frequency power, À17.85\% (95\%CI À32.34, À0.25), and lower lowfrequency/high-frequency ratio À24.29\% (95\% CI 38.08, 7.42) compared to those in the ‘‘low strain’’ category.
Conclusions High job strain and low job control among medical residents were associated with several indicators of lowered heart rate variability. Thus, analysis of heart rate variability may be an informative marker for evaluating the physiological impacts of workplace stressors. Am. J. Ind. Med.},

Summary of Key Points: There is evidence that occupational metabolic demands and work organizations characterized by reduced worker control are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. It is biologically plausible that these two factors interact to create a preclinical, intermediate state of fatigue (burnout) that is a critical component in the causal path from occupational factors to CVD. Physical therapists are uniquely qualiﬁed to contribute to an understanding of these mechanisms and their resultant implications for work organization, rehabilitation, and health promotion. Statement of Recommendations: Physical therapists engaged in ergonomic job analysis should consider work related metabolic demands, worker control, and fatigue in their assessment of risk for injury and illness, in recommendations for return to work, and in the prescription of health promotion leisure time physical activity .},

Many of the etiological theories surrounding these associations incriminate some deviation of autonomic nervous system activity. New methods of analyzing cardiovascular data obtained from a Holter monitor provide a window into a worker's autonomic nervous system throughout the day, in many cases for two days. These methods allow a variety of comparisons, for example, between workers of varying job stress levels, between work days and rest days, day and night, and between high stress and low stress periods. Identifying altered autonomic nervous system activity patterns throughout the day may: 1. provide insight into the etiology of stress related pathologies; 2. allow quantification of exposure; 3. investigate possible interaction effects of different exposures; 4. lead to monitoring methods capable of identifying whether an employee's job stress is increasing his or her risk for disease.},

[Purpose] This study was performed to examine the relationship between physical performance and muscle properties during police cadet training. The study’s hypothesis was that improved physical performance brought about by training, would in turn cause a reduction in muscle flexibility. [Subjects and Methods] Fifty-nine police cadets were included in this study. Standard fitness tests and quantitative assessments of muscular biomechanical properties were conducted before, during and after the 20-week cadet training. [Results] General fitness had improved at the end of the police cadet training. There was no significant decrease in muscle flexibility as measured by the Sit-and-Reach test. However, muscle compliance of the non-dominant leg measured by the relaxation coefficient had decreased at the end of the police cadet training. [Conclusion] The increased sit-and-reach distance could be due in part to strengthening of the abdominal muscles. On the other hand, the biomechanical test, which was specific to muscle extensibility, showed a reduction in the relaxation coefficient of the non-dominant leg. Our data suggests that changes in muscle compliance as a result of lower extremity training should be considered. This data may be useful in the design of a training protocol that prevents the potential injuries caused by reduced muscle flexibility.},

	abstract = {© 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd. Background. Recent studies have shown that shape and morphology of photoplethysmography (PPG) waveform can provide useful information about cardiovascular system. These parameters namely pulse amplitude, pulse width, pulse rise time and pulse reflected delay have been studied independently and there is information about the interaction of these parameters. There is no detailed description of calculating these parameters. We have described a detailed algorithm for calculating these parameters. We also investigated a new parameter calculated using area under the curve of PPG waveform (AUCPPG). All parameter were calculated using finger probe oximeter sensor from 22 subjects before and after orthostatic stress. Changes inAUCPPGwere compared against pulse interval, amplitude, width, rise time of PPG pulse and pulse reflection delay (PRD). Results. We found that all parameters showed a decrease with orthostatic stress. PPG pulse width parameter was very inconsistent and changed significantly based on small change in shape of PPG waveform. AUCPPG showed strong correlation with pulse amplitude (r 0.85) in supine position, but that relationship decreased in upright position (r 0.64) as reflected peaks became more distinct and separated. Multivariable regression showed that PRD and rise had negative influence on AUCPPG. Male subjects showed higher AUCPPG values. Conclusion. We conclude that all PPG based parameters are effected by subject's position. Although AUCPPGis correlated with PAP width, it is an independent parameter that can be calculated more consistently than pulse width. From the results of our sample population we conclude AUCPPG is a better indicator of change in vascular tone than PAP amplitude or PAP width. Unlike other parameters AUCPPG incorporates the influence of both PAP and reflected waves.},

Participants: Convenience sample of 615 patients with musculoskeletal conditions (mean age, 38.1y) participating in an active physiotherapy program. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcomes Measures: A 22-item Mobility Activities Measure by using a self-report questionnaire that assessed whether patients had limitations on daily activities across major ICF categories of mobility subdomains. Factor analysis, tests of item scaling, internal consistency reliability analysis, Rasch item response theory modeling, and modified parallel analysis were used. Results: Initial exploratory factor analysis results for each ICF subdomain produced a total of 5 distinct and interpretable factors or dimensions: changing and maintaining body position involving sitting and/or lying; changing and maintaining body position involving standing up; carrying, moving, and handling objects using the hand and shoulder; carrying, moving, and handling objects using the hand and/or forearm; and walking and moving. Dimensionality of these 5 factors was verified by using confirmatory factor analyses and scaling assumptions were met for each dimension. Rasch scaling and modified parallel analysis supported the unidimensionality. Conclusions: The Mobility Activities Measure is a promising new self-report measure of mobility activities as defined by the ICF.

Method Using qualitative research methods, fifteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients who received physical rehabilitation during hospital stay in an acute care hospital in Murcia, Spain. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, analyzed, and grouped into predetermined and emergent codes. Results Patients described three main themes in continuity of care: informational, management, and relational continuity. Several factors were described as influencing the perceived gaps in these three types of continuity. Informational continuity was influenced by the transfer of information among care providers. Relational continuity was influenced by patient–therapist relations and consistency on the part of the provider. Management continuity was influenced by consistency of care between providers and the involvement of patients in their own care. Conclusion The participants in this study identified several gaps in three types of continuity of care (informational, management, and relational). Inpatients often perceive their experiences of rehabilitation as being disconnected or incoherent over time.},

	abstract = {Physical therapy is common following a knee surgery. With rising healthcare costs there is debate as to the appropriateness of outpatient physical therapy following such interventions. Many of the existing controlled trials have concluded that there is no benefit to subjects that receive supervised physical therapy when compared to subjects that perform their exercises at home. The purpose of this systematic review was to consider the existing evidence regarding benefit following knee surgery and evaluate the quality, internal and external validity of such evidence. Ten studies, all randomized control trials, were found to be applicable to our review. Using the PEDro scale all studies were considered at least moderate in quality. Many of the studies had designs that biased the home exercise group, providing supervision similar to that provided by outpatient physical therapy. In select young and healthy population with few co morbidities supervised physical therapy is no more beneficial than a home exercise program following relatively simple knee surgical procedures (arthroscopic meniscetomy). However there is a lack of evidence regarding older populations with co morbidities or for more complicated knee surgical procedures (ACL reconstruction, Total Knee Arthoplasty) prohibiting a conclusion at this time for these populations and/or these procedures. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Objective: To identify elements of the environment that patients consider when evaluating the quality of a care experience in outpatient rehabilitation settings. Design: A qualitative study using a modified grounded theory approach. Data collection used semistructured interviewing during 9 focus groups. Setting: Three postacute ambulatory centers in metropolitan areas. Participants: Adults (N=57; 33 men, 24 women) undergoing outpatient rehabilitation for musculoskeletal conditions/injuries. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Not applicable. Results: Participants perceived the quality of rehabilitation service on the basis of their experiences with environmental factors, including 3 physical factors (facility design, ambient conditions, and social factors) and 4 organizational factors (duration of attendance, interruptions during delivery of care, waiting times in the sequence of treatment, and patient safety). Conclusions: This study identifies the specific environmental attributes that patients consider important when evaluating the quality of outpatient rehabilitation settings and develops a patient-based framework for assessing the overall perception of service quality. Further research should work to develop self-report questionnaires about patient experiences with the environment in rehabilitation services to provide empirical and quantitative evidence. © 2013 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.},
