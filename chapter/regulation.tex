\chapter{Muscle Regulation}\label{chp:regulation}
Updated on \today
\minitoc

This chapter introduces the mechanisms utilized by the CNS to regulate active tension. To regulate active tension means to vary its force from its lowest value (resting tone) to its maximal value (maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)). Active tension is developed at the level of the sarcomere, excitation at the level of the muscle fiber, regulation occurs at the level of motor units. A motor unit includes an $\alpha$-motor neuron and all of the muscle fibers it innervates. The CNS has two strategies to regulate active tension. One strategy is to manipulate the number of twitches per second (frequency summation or rate coding); and the second strategy is to manipulate the number of motor units twitching (motor unit summation or motor unit recruitment). Between these two approaches there is a nearly continuous variation in active tension possible, with some muscles (fine motor) having a greater capacity for continuous variation than others (gross motor).

\section{Motor Units}

A motor unit is an $\alpha$-motor neuron and all of muscle fibers that its terminal axon branches form a neuromuscular junction at a motor end plate. Each muscle fiber has one motor end plate, and therefore one neuromuscular junction. However, each $\alpha$-motor neuron has many terminal axon branches. The muscle fibers of a single motor unit are randomly dispersed throughout the muscle epimysium. Meaning the muscle fibers of a motor unit contribute to the tension developed in several different fascicles. This arrangement ensures that when only a few motor units are excited there are muscle fibers throughout the entire muscle generating tension at the tendon attachments and not an asymmetrical pull from one fascicle or isolated location within the epimysium.

\subsection{Innervation Ratio}
Motor unit innervation ratio (IR) refers to the number of muscle fibers per motor unit and is usually given as the average number of muscle fibers per motor unit.

\begin{equation}
    IR = \frac{N_{mf}}{N_{mu}}
\end{equation}

The IR varies between muscles and differentiates muscles that are well equipped for fine and gross motor control (See Table \ref{table:Innervation_Ratios}).

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{||c c c c||} 
 \hline
 Muscle & $\alpha$-motor neurons & Muscle Fibers ($\times 10^3$) & Innervation Ratio \\ [0.5ex] 
 \hline\hline
 Biceps  & 774 & 580 & 749 \\ 
 Brachialis & 330 & 130 & 393 \\
 Lumbricals &  98 & 10.3 & 105 \\ 
 Gastrocnemius & 580 & 1000 & 1724 \\[1ex] 
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Variability of Innervation Ratio in Human Muscles (\footnotesize{From \cite{buchthal_motor_1980}})}
\label{table:Innervation_Ratios}
\end{table}

Innervation ratios for whole muscles are explanatory for the concept of fine motor and gross motor control. Considering tension is developed by muscle fibers, and hundreds to thousands of muscle fibers are recruited with each new motor unit recruitment, muscles with lower IRs have greater regulation (control) over the amount of tension they produce. They more nearly approach continuous increments in tension with each new motor unit recruited. Of the four muscles in Table \ref{table:Innervation_Ratios}, the lumbricals (muscle in the hand) has the greatest fine motor control. While the gastrocnemius is responsible for the greatest need for high tension (force) output (gross motor control).

\subsection{Motor Unit \& Muscle Fiber Types}

While IRs for whole muscle are interesting for motor control they tend to ignore the fact that there is systematic variation in the number of muscle fibers per motor unit within a muscle. It is clear that there are different types of motor units, and that the types include differences in both the $\alpha$-motor neuron and the muscle fibers. These differences are structural and functional. It is also clear that motor unit types exist on a spectrum, but despite the spectrum experts have identified and agree on a classification system that includes three types of human motor units \cite{lieber_skeletal_2010}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Fast Fatigable (FF) Motor Units with Type 2a or Fast Glycolytic (FG) Muscle Fibers
    \item Fast Resistant (FR) Motor Units with Type 2x or Fast Oxidatitive (FOG) Muscle Fibers
    \item Slow (S) Motor Units with Type 1 or Slow Oxidative (SO) Muscle Fibers
\end{itemize}

The above classification names are all utilized, however the Type 1, 2x and 2a are probably (unfortantely) the most common. The other classifications are more informative about the functional characteristics of the motor units and muscle fibers they innervate.

\subsubsection{Fast \& Slow}

The terms fast and slow refer to relative differences in four characteristics, two for the $\alpha$-motor neuron and two for the muscle fibers. 

\paragraph{Fast \& Slow $\alpha$-Motor Neurons}
For the motor unit $\alpha$-motor neuron they refer to how quickly excitations can be sent and thus how frequently they can be excited (the faster an excitation propagates down an axon the sooner it is ready for another excitation). So a fast neuron has a higher nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and a higher maximum excitation frequency (Hz) than a slow neuron.

NCV is related to the size of the neuron (diameter) because diameter influences resistance to current (flow of electrical impulses and therefore directly related to velocity). Diameter is inversely proportional to resistance, and resistance is inversely proportional to current, therefore diameter is directly proportional to current and velocity. The large diameter of the $\alpha$-motor neurons, combined with the myelin sheaths (See Figure \ref{fig:Motoneuron}, contribute to its relatively high NCV. 

Table \ref{table:NCV} shows the estimated NCV for three nerve fiber types. The $\alpha$-motor neuron has the highest NCV. The variation in diameter in these motor neurons is explained by the motor unit types with the fast (FF) motor units innervating the FG fibers having the larger diameter ($\simeq 22 \mu m$) on the higher end for NCV ($\simeq 120 m \cdot s^{-1}$), and the S motor units with the small diameters ($\simeq 12 \mu m$)and the lower end of NCV ($\simeq 70 m \cdot s^{-1}$) (and FR motor units innervating FOG somewhere in the middle). 

It's important to keep in mind that for motor unit neurons fast and slow are relative to one another. As is clear in Table \ref{table:Innervation_Ratios} they are both much faster than the other neurons listed.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{||c c c c ||} 
 \hline
Nerve Fiber & Diameter (\mu m) & NCV ($m \cdot s^{-1}$) & Function \\ 
 \hline\hline
 $\alpha$-motor & 12-22 & 70-120 & motor \\ 
 $\delta$-sensory & 1-5 & 12-30 & sharp pain \\
 C & 0.5-1.2 & 0.2-2 & dull pain \\ [1ex] 
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{NCV for different nerve fiber types. Note: C fibers are unmyelinated, whereas $\alpha$-motor and $\delta$-sensory fibers are myelinated. Therefore, C fibers have a larger drop in NCV estimated just from diameter. \footnotesize{Data from \cite{feher_quantitative_2017}}}
\label{table:NCV}
\end{table}

Along with a larger diameter the fast motor unit neurons innervate a larger number of muscle fibers.

\subsection{Motor Unit Types}

There are three motor unit types using a classification based on measurements on motor unit twitch tension, twitch time and fatigue index (See Table \ref{table:Motor_Unit_Types}.

\section{Motor Unit Excitation}

An $\alpha$-motor neuron, once excited, will release only one neurotransmitter, ACh at its axon terminal. ACh will only have one effect at the NMJ, creating excitatory micro-potentials on the motor end plate. However, in the Central Nervous System (such as the Spinal Cord) competing neurotransmitters can be released at synapses of the $\alpha$-motor neuron dendrites. The impact of these neurotransmitters can be excitatory or inhibitory. Since they occur after the synaspse they are called excitatory post synaptic potentiations (EPSPs) or inhibitory post synaptic potentiations (IPSPs). Whether, and how frequently, an $\alpha$-motor neuron sends an excitation to the muscle fibers it innervates is balanced by competition between the EPSPs and the IPSPs.



\subsection{Motor Unit Twitch}

A single excitation of a muscle fiber produces enough activation to create a twitch, making a twitch the fundamental unit of active tension. In this chapter the concept of a muscle fiber twitch is scaled up to a motor unit twitch. While a muscle fiber twitch is the fundamental unit of active tension, a motor unit twitch is the fundamental unit of movement.\footnotemark\footnotetext{Just a note that by "unit" we don't mean unit as in a unit of measurement. Other words for how we are using the word unit may be "element" or "atom" or "particle".}

Difference between motor unit twitch $T_{mu}$ and muscle fiber twitch $T_{mf}$


\begin{equation}
    T_{mu} = N_ \cdot T_{mf} = N \cdot A \cdot T_s
\end{equation}

$N$ refers to the number of muscle fibers and in the above equation since there is only one motor unit being considered N can be taken as the the innervation ratio (IR)

$A$ refers to the cross sectional area - an indication of how many sarcomeres are in parallel in the fiber

$T_s$ refers to the tension created for each unit of cross sectional area

$IR = \frac{N_{mf}}{N_{mu}}$ (Note, when there is one motor unit, $N = IR = N_{mf}$)

Why is there more tension in a FF motor unit excitation and FG muscle fiber twitch? Three reasons: first, because there are more muscle fibers in a FF motor unit ($N_{mf}$). Second, because the muscle fibers in the FF motor unit have greater cross sectional area ($A$). Third, and to a much lesser extent, because the sarcomeres of a FG muscle fiber create more tension per twitch even when controlling for $A$ ($T_s$) \cite{bodine_maximal_1987}. Although this third reason remains controversial due to the small difference between the $T_s$ of FG and SO muscle fibers \cite{lieber_skeletal_2010}. Some sources equate the $T_s$ between the two fiber types, $T_s \simeq 20 N \cdot cm^{-2}$ \cite{feher_quantitative_2017}, whereas others report them separately with albeit different estimates, FG $T_s \simeq 22 N \cdot cm^{-2}$, and SO $T_s \simeq 15 N \cdot cm^{-2}$ \cite{lieber_skeletal_2010}.

\section{Regulatory Feedback}

It is estimated that between 40\% to 70\% of the nerves in a nerve bundle to a skeletal muscle fiber are $\alpha$-motor neurons (\underline{e}fferent nerves, \underline{e}xiting the spinal cord). The remaining axons are from sensor nerves (\underline{a}fferent nerves, \underline{a}ccessing the spinal cord). Regulation of tension is critically dependent on knowing whether the intention of tension is being met (whatever that intention may be) so that tension can be adjusted as necessary. Since neither motor control or neuroscience is a focus of this book (or course) this section is brief and focused on the muscle spindles and golgi tendon organs (GTOs) and how they influence tension regulation in the the spinal cord. 

\subsection{Muscle Spindles}

Muscle spindles are receptors that are excited when stretched and provide the central nervous system with information about muscle length and rate of stretching. With this information the muscle spindles are important contributors to proprioception (sensation and perception of position and movement). They are located within fascicles along side (parallel to) muscle fibers. It is conventional, once speaking of the muscle spindle, to refer to muscle fibers as extrafusal fibers (not part of the muscle spindle). The muscle spindles have both afferent and efferent innervation and their own small set of intrafusal contractile fibers. The intrafusal fibers are innervated by $\gamma$-motor neurons and allow the muscle spindle to adjust to the length of the muscle to remain sensitive to changes in length (See Figure \ref{fig:MuscleSpindle}). 

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figure/MuscleSpindle.png}
    \caption{Muscle Spindle \footnotesize{\href{https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MuscleSpindle.svg}{Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 4.0})}}
    \label{fig:MuscleSpindle}
\end{figure}

Afferent signals from the muscle spindles terminate at the spinal cord as well as higher up in the central nervous system for long loop reflexes and coordination (cerebellum) and the cerebral cortex (proprioception). The response of muscle spindles to a rapid increase in length (quick stretch) signals the dendrites of the $\alpha$-motor neurons of the agonist (same muscle that is being stretched) with excitatory post synaptic potentiations (EPSPs); and the dendrites of the $\alpha$-motor neurons of the antagonist (opposite muscles of those that are being stretched) with inhibitory post synaptic potentiations (IPSPs). Collectively these actions are referred to as the stretch reflex. If the stretch is quick enough and excites enough muscle spindles the EPSPs are sufficient enough to excite $\alpha$-motor neurons which provoke muscle excitation and activation. Testing stretch reflexes are an important component of a physical exam when the integrity of the $\alpha$-motor neuron is in question.

\subsection{Golgi Tendon Organs}

Golgi tendon organs (GTOs) are on the mostly tendon side of the transition space known as the musculotendinous junction. They are so close to muscle fibers that each GTO is connected in series with 5-20 muscle fibers. In this position the GTOs are detect tension in muscle and tendinous fibers \cite{macefield_physiological_2005}. The GTO is excited by tension within the muscle fibers or tendon. Afferent impulses from the GTOs terminate in the spinal cord and cerebellum. GTO afferents in the spinal cord results in IPSPs of the agonist muscle. Inhibiting the agonist limits active tension as a protective mechanism.

\section{\textit{Clinical Physiology Connections}}

\subsection{Electromyogram (EMG)}

Each time a muscle fiber is activated it is caused by an action potential from the nerve to the motor end plate, and along the sarcolemma of all the fibers that are innervated by that $\alpha$-motor neuron. Therefore, each muscle fiber activation is associated with an electrical signal. An EMG electrode near the fiber can record this electrical activity. The electrode can either be a small needle that acts as an antenna to record local electrical activity or a surface electrode (sEMG). If using a needle, the raw EMG signal can be used to accurately determine when a particular muscle is active (regardless of depth or size of the muscle). sEMG can be used to determine when a particular muscle is active when the muscle of interest is superficial and large enough to avoid cross talk at the sEMG electrode. 

\paragraph{EMG quantification} It is difficult to quantify the activity of a muscle from a raw EMG signal. The EMG contains electrical signals from every muscle fiber in the vicinity of the EMG electrode which creates a very noisy signal (See Figure \ref{fig:EMG_ARV}. From the raw signal the Average Rectified Voltage (ARV) EMG can be computed. ARV is a time-windowed mean of the absolute value of the signal (turns all voltages into positive values). ARV is useful for further analysis such as recording the excitation patterns of a muscles that may include changes in excitation or as the first step towards more advanced analyses \cite{merletti_surface_2016}. The relationship between EMG activity and muscle tension is most valuable during isometric activation because the association between activation and tension changes with changes in length (length-tension relationship), and with different velocities (force-velocity relationship).

    \caption{Raw (upper) and ARV (lower) EMG Signals \footnotesize{Data collected using Biopaq acquisition hardware and Acknowledge software in the author's lab (SC)}}
    \label{fig:EMG_ARV}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Biofeedback}

sEMG is a valuable form of biofeedback to indicate that a certain muscle has been activated. Commercially available devices provide visual or auditory signals so a patient can learn to activate a muscle. Common applications of the EMG for biofeedback is activation in the vastus medialis after anterior cruciate ligament surgery, or the lower trapezius during shoulder flexion or abduction.

\paragraph{Motor Unit Number and Size Indices (MUNIX \& MUSIX)}

The motor unit number index (MUNIX) and the motor unit size index (MUSIX) are based on sEMG data interpreted through a mathematical model to estimate an index of the number and size of functional $\alpha$-motor neurons for a muscle \cite{nandedkar_motor_2004}. MUNIX is not an absolute count of motor units, and MUSIX is not an absolute size of the motor units. But they do provide an estimate that correlates with other measures and they have reasonable reliability. Considering the test only takes 3-5 minutes per muscle, is non-invasive and relatively comfortable (as compared to other approaches), they have gained popularity in clinical neurology and neurophysiology. MUNIX is considered an effective bio-marker for assessing disease progression and an alternative clinical trial outcome in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It has also been proposed for use in the evaluation of peripheral neuropathies, particularly in demyelinating neuropathies with conduction block. While there have been less studies, MUNIX is starting to be evaluated in a variety of central nervous system disorders (such as spinal cord injury, stroke, and cerebral palsy \cite{fatehi_utility_2018}. 

A study of healthy individuals between 20 and 80 years of age demonstrated a reduction in MUNIX and MUSIX values with aging, particularly over the age of 60, indicating that they may be a valuable biomarker for research on the prevention and treatment of age related sarcopenia \cite{cao_reference_2020}. Sarcopenia is an age-related progressive loss of muscle mass and strength. It is a type of muscle atrophy primarily caused by the aging process and certainly confounded by physical inactivity and malnutrition. If a loss of motor units is inevitable with aging, then healthy aging would strive for lifestyles that promote increasing MUSIX despite an inevitable decline in MUNIX. A consequence of this shift (reduced MUNIX and increased MUSIX) would be a reduction in muscle tension regulation. Therefore, the choice of lifestyle would need to consider the motor control (balance, coordination) capabilities in such individuals.

\subsection{Nerve Conduction Velocity (NCV)}

Nerve conduction velocity (NCV) refers to the time it takes for an excitation to travel a certain distance. It can be measured clinical with electrodiagnostic testing that includes EMG. A stimulus is presented proximally at a peripheral nerve and the distal muscle excitation (via EMG) or axonal excitation is measured. NCV

The tight regulation of active tension for coordinated movements requires for fidelity in the signals coming from the central nervous system.\footnotemark\footnotetext{Fidelity in this context means that intended signals are accurately sent where and when they are requested.} If the myelin sheath of an $\alpha$-motor neuron is damaged the NCV is reduced. If the NCV is reduced then the ability to activate muscles with high fidelity signals is impaired resulting in delays in the generation of active tension, limiting the ability to increase active tension when needed. These changes occur for two reasons, first, limitations in frequency summation, and second, limitations in motor unit summation. This is precisely what happens in peripheral demyelinating diseases such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy, Anti-Myelin Associated Glycoprotein Neuropathy, and demyelinating disease known as Multiple Sclerosis also impairs signal fidelity, however, it is a central nervous system condition. Therefore, the loss of signal fidelity does not directly alter the peripheral NCV, it impairs the central NCV which interrupts signals that excite the motor unit dendrites in the spinal cord which tends to present as a more complicated, nuanced and variable clinical presentation (in terms of the impact it can have on motor function such as coordination).
