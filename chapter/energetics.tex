\chapter{Muscle Energetics}\label{chp:energetics}

\minitoc

All prior chapters include important molecular processes for muscle function that require the use of adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) to provide required energy. Even the resting state of the muscle fiber is in continuous need for ATP to maintain the membrane potential. This chapter covers the biochemical pathways utilized by muscle fibers to convert fuel (macro-nutrients) into ATP.
