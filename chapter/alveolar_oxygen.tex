This chapter covers pulmonary ventilation to support alveolar blood gases.

This chapter presents an incomplete story of overall pulmonary support for the mass balance of $O_2$ and $CO_2$. It leaves off with alveolar respiration, and only considers alveolar respiration at one alveolus. In the next chapter we consider ventilation (breathing) mechanics and the process of drawing air into and out of the alveoli. Without continuous alveolar ventilation ($V_A$) there is no alveolar respiration; and without ventilation ($V_e$), there is no $V_A$. We also consider the important consideration of the distribution of $V_e$ throughout the lungs that results in regional differences in $V_A$, and the distribution of pulmonary perfusion ($\dot{Q}$). Because alveolar respiration cannot occur unless there is $V_A$ matched with capillary blood flow (perfusion). 

%The regulation of blood $O_2$ and $CO_2$ includes monitoring these values with chemoreceptors, but the efferent (action) side of these regulatory pathways include variations in ventilation.

Chapter \ref{chp:alveolar_oxygen} on Ventilation considers the concept of ventilation - perfusion $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$ matching, the impact of body position on $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$ matching zones, and the impact of $\dot{V}/\dot{Q}$ matching on the $P_AO_2-P_aO_2$ gradient, otherwise known as the A-a gradient.
