\chapter{Micro-circulatory support of Extracellular Fluid}\label{chp:ecf_microcirculation}

\minitoc
Muscle fibers are dependent on the extra cellular fluid environment. This chapter covers the micro circulatory processes that support that environment. Specifically how the contents of the capillaries are exchanged with the ECF, and the role of the lymph flow to keep local ECF stabilized.
